			"K'un represents what is great and originating, penetrating,  advantageous, correct and having the firmness of a mare.  When the superior man has to make any movement, if he takes the initiative, he will go astray; if he follows, he will find his proper path.

			"Shih indicates how, in the case which it supposes, with firmness and correctness, and a leader of age and experience there will be good fortune and no error.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name Shih describes the multitude of the host.  The firmness and correctness which the hexagram indicates refer to more correctness of aim.  When the mover is able to use the multitude with such correctness, he may attain to the royal sway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the symbol of strength in the centre of the trigram below, and it is responded to by its proper correlate above.

			"Ch'ien indicates progress and success.  The superior man, being humble as it implies, will have a good issue to his undertakings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCh'ien indicates progress and success.  It is the way of heaven to send down its beneficial influences below, where they are brilliantly displayed.  It is the way of earth, lying low, to send its influences upwards and there to act.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the way of Heaven to diminish the full and augment the humble.  It is the way of earth to overthrow the full and replenish the humble.  Spiritual Beings inflict calamity on the full and bless the humble.  It is the way of men to hate the full and love the humble.  Humility in a position of honor makes that still more brilliant; and in a low position men will not seek to pass beyond it.  Thus it is that the superior man will have a good issue to his undertakings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram for the earth and that of a mountain in the midst of it form Ch'ien.

Thus the way of the superior man appears increasing, and that of the small man decreasing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigrams for heaven and earth in communication together form T'ai.  The sage sovereign, in harmony with this, fashions and completes his regulations after the courses of heaven and earth, and assists the application of the adaptations furnished by them, in order to benefit the people.\n",
			"Yu indicates that, in the state which it implies, feudal princes may be set up, and the hosts put in motion, with advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Yu we see the strong line responded to by all the others, and the will of him whom it represents being carried out; and also docile obedience employing movement for its purposes.  From these things come Yu the Condition of harmony and satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this condition we have docile obedience employing movement for its purposes, and therefore it is so as between heaven and earth; how much more will it be so among men in the setting up of feudal princes and putting the hosts in motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven and earth show that docile obedience in connection with  movement and hence the sun and moon make no error in time, and the four seasons do not deviate from their order.

			"Ch&ecirc;n gives the intimation of ease and development.  When the time of movement which it indicates comes, the subject of the hexagram will be found looking out with apprehension, and yet smiling and talking cheerfully.  When the movement like a crash of thunder terrifies all within a hundred li, he will be like the sincere worshipper who is not startled into letting go his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\nCh&ecirc;n gives the intimation of ease and development.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the time of movement which it indicates comes, its subject will be found looking out with apprehension:  that feeling of dread leads to happiness.  An yet smiling and talking cheerfully:  the issue of his dread is that he adopts proper laws for his course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movement like a crash of thunder terrifies all within a hundred li:  it startles the distant and frightens the near.

If heaven and earth were to have no intercommunication, things would not grow and flourish as they do.  The marriage of a younger sister is the end of her maidenhood and the beginning of her motherhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have in the hexagram the desire of pleasure and, on the ground of that, movement following.  The marrying away is of a younger sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny action will be evil: the places of the lines are not those appropriate to them.

There will be in this way great good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Hsiao Kuo we see the small lines exceeding the others, and giving the intimation of progress and attainment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch exceeding, in order to its being advantageous, must be associated with firmness and correctness:  that is, it must take place only according to the requirements of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weak lines are in the central places, and hence it is said that what the name denotes may be done in small affairs, and there will be good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the strong lines one is not in its proper place, and the other is not central, hence it is said that what the name denotes should not be done in great affairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the hexagram we have the symbol of a bird on the wing, and of the notes that come down from such a bird, for which it is better to descend than to ascend, thereby leading to great good fortune:  to ascend is contrary to what is reasonable in the case, while to descend is natural and right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing a hill and that for thunder above it form Hsiao Kuo.

When the moon has become full, it begins to wane.  The interaction of heaven and earth is now vigorous and abundant, now dull and scanty, growing and diminishing according to the seasons.

The four seasons, by their changing and transforming, can perpetuate their production of things.  The sages persevere long in their course, and all under the sky are transformed and perfect.  When we look at what they continue doing long, the natural tendencies of heaven, earth, and all things can be seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing thunder and that for wind form H&ecirc;ng.

That action in accordance with this will be of high value tells us that advance will be followed by achievement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dangerous height of heaven cannot be ascended; the difficult places of the earth are mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds.

			"Looking at Ching, we think of how the site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no change.  The water of a well never disappears and never receives any great increase, and those who come and those who go can draw and enjoy the benefit.  If the drawing have nearly been accomplished, but before the rope has quite reached the water, the bucket is broken, this is evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the symbol of wood in the water and the raising of the water; which gives us the idea of a well.
