  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <span id="last-updated"></span></p>
  <p>Yijing respects your privacy. This policy describes how the app handles your data.</p>
  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The app provides optional AI chat features. When you use AI chat, the text you enter and the AI's responses are sent to a third-party AI service solely to generate replies. The app does not retain this data after the conversation or transmit it elsewhere.</p>
  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <p>Apart from AI chat, the app stores files only on your device under <code>Documents\\Yijing</code>. These files remain on your device and are not uploaded or shared.</p>
  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Yijing does not collect personal information, track users, or share data with other parties.</p>
  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the AI chat feature at any time. To remove data saved in <code>Documents\\Yijing</code>, delete the folder.</p>
  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the developer through the support information provided in the app's Microsoft Store listing or via the project's repository.</p>
