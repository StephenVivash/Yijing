			"K'un represents what is great and originating, penetrating,  advantageous, correct and having the firmness of a mare.  When the superior man has to make any movement, if he takes the initiative, he will go astray; if he follows, he will find his proper path.  The advantageousness will be seen in his getting friends from the southwest, and losing friends in the northeast.  If he rests in correctness and firmness, there will be good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nComplete is the great and originating capacity indicated by K'un!  All things owe to it their birth;  it receives obediently the influences of Heaven.<br/>\n<br/>\nK'un, in its largeness, supports and contains all things.  Its excellent capacity matches the unlimited power of Ch'ien.  Its comprehension is wide, and its brightness great.

Its power of moving on the earth is without limit;  it is mild and docile, advantageous and firm:  such is the course of the superior man.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he take the initiative, he goes astray:  he misses, that is, his proper course.  If he follow, he is docile, and gets into his regular course.  In the southwest he will get friends:  he will be walking with those of his own class.  In the northeast he will lose friends:  but in the end there will be ground for congratulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good fortune arising from resting in firmness corresponds to the unlimited capacity of the earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe capacity and sustaining power of the earth is what is denoted by K'un.  The superior man, in accordance with this, with his large virtue supports men and things.\n",
			"Fu indicates that there will be free course and progress in what it denotes.  The subject of it finds no one to distress him in his exits and entrances; friends come to him, and no error is committed. He will return and repeat his proper course.  In seven days comes his return.  There will be advantage in whatever direction movement is made.<br/>\n<br/>\nFu indicates the free course and progress of what it denotes:  it is the coming back of what is intended by the undivided line.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts subject's actions show movement directed by accordance with natural order.  Hence he finds no one to distress him in his exits and entrances, and friends come to him, and no error is committed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will return and repeat his proper course; in seven days comes his return:  such is the movement of the heavenly revolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be advantage in whatever direction movement is made: the strong lines are growing and increasing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we not see in Fu the mind of heaven and earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing the earth and that for thunder in the midst of it form Fu.  The ancient kings, in accordance with this, on the day of the winter solstice, shut the gates of the passes from one state to another, so that the traveling merchants could not then pursue their journeys, nor the princes go on with the inspection of their states.\n",
			"Shih indicates how, in the case which it supposes, with firmness and correctness, and a leader of age and experience there will be good fortune and no error.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name Shih describes the multitude of the host.  The firmness and correctness which the hexagram indicates refer to more correctness of aim.  When the mover is able to use the multitude with such correctness, he may attain to the royal sway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the symbol of strength in the centre of the trigram below, and it is responded to by its proper correlate above.  The action gives rise to perils, but it is in accordance with the best sentiments of men.  Its mover may by such action distress all the country, but the people will follow him:  there will be good fortune, and what error should there be?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing the earth and in the midst of it that representing water, form Shih.  The superior man, in accordance with this, nourishes and educates the people, and collects from among them the multitudes of the host.\n",
			"Lin indicates that under the conditions supposed in it there will be great progress and success, while it will be advantageous to be firmly correct. In the eighth month there will be evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Lin we see the strong lines gradually increasing and advancing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lower trigram is the symbol of being pleased, and the upper of being compliant.  The strong line is in the central position, and is properly responded to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is great progress and success, along with firm correctness:  this is the way of Heaven.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the eighth month there will be evil:  the advancing power will decay after no long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram for the waters of a marsh and that for the earth above it form Lin.  The superior man, in accordance with this, has his proposes of instruction that are inexhaustible, and nourishes and supports the people without limit.\n",
			"Ch'ien indicates progress and success.  The superior man, being humble as it implies, will have a good issue to his undertakings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCh'ien indicates progress and success.  It is the way of heaven to send down its beneficial influences below, where they are brilliantly displayed.  It is the way of earth, lying low, to send its influences upwards and there to act.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the way of Heaven to diminish the full and augment the humble.  It is the way of earth to overthrow the full and replenish the humble.  Spiritual Beings inflict calamity on the full and bless the humble.  It is the way of men to hate the full and love the humble.  Humility in a position of honor makes that still more brilliant; and in a low position men will not seek to pass beyond it.  Thus it is that the superior man will have a good issue to his undertakings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram for the earth and that of a mountain in the midst of it form Ch'ien.  The  superior man, in accordance with this, diminishes what is excessive in himself, and increases where there is any defect, bringing about an equality, according to the nature of the case, in his treatment of himself and others.\n",

The case of king Wan was that of one who with these qualities was yet involved in great difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be advantageous to realize the difficulty of the position, and maintain firm correctness:  that is , the individual concerned should obscure his brightness.  The case of the count of Ki was that of one who, amidst the difficulties of his house was able thus to maintain his aim and mind correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing the earth and that for the bright sun entering within it form Ming I.  The superior man, in accordance with this, conducts his management of men; he shows his intelligence by keeping it obscured.\n",
			"Sh&ecirc;ng indicates that under its conditions there will be great progress and success.  Seeking by the qualities implied in it to meet with the great man, its subject need have no anxiety.  Advance to the south will be fortunate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe find the weak line, as it finds the opportunity, ascending upwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the attribute of flexibility and that of obedience;  we have the strong line below and its proper correlate above:  these things indicate that there will be great progress and success.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeking by the qualities implied in Sh&ecirc;ng to meet with the great man, its subject need have no anxiety:  there will be ground for congratulation.

Thus the way of the superior man appears increasing, and that of the small man decreasing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigrams for heaven and earth in communication together form T'ai.  The sage sovereign, in harmony with this, fashions and completes his regulations after the courses of heaven and earth, and assists the application of the adaptations furnished by them, in order to benefit the people.\n",
			"Yu indicates that, in the state which it implies, feudal princes may be set up, and the hosts put in motion, with advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Yu we see the strong line responded to by all the others, and the will of him whom it represents being carried out; and also docile obedience employing movement for its purposes.  From these things come Yu the Condition of harmony and satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this condition we have docile obedience employing movement for its purposes, and therefore it is so as between heaven and earth; how much more will it be so among men in the setting up of feudal princes and putting the hosts in motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven and earth show that docile obedience in connection with  movement and hence the sun and moon make no error in time, and the four seasons do not deviate from their order.  The sages show such docile obedience in connection with their movements, and hence their punishments and penalties are entirely just, and the people acknowledge it by their submission.  Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Yu.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigrams for the earth and thunder issuing from it with its crashing noise for Yu.  The ancient kings, in accordance with this, composed their music and did honor to virtue, presenting it especially and most grandly to God, when they associated with him at the service their highest ancestor and their father.\n",
			"Ch&ecirc;n gives the intimation of ease and development.  When the time of movement which it indicates comes, the subject of the hexagram will be found looking out with apprehension, and yet smiling and talking cheerfully.  When the movement like a crash of thunder terrifies all within a hundred li, he will be like the sincere worshipper who is not startled into letting go his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\nCh&ecirc;n gives the intimation of ease and development.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the time of movement which it indicates comes, its subject will be found looking out with apprehension:  that feeling of dread leads to happiness.  An yet smiling and talking cheerfully:  the issue of his dread is that he adopts proper laws for his course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movement like a crash of thunder terrifies all within a hundred li:  it startles the distant and frightens the near.  He will be like the sincere worshipper, who is not startled into letting go his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits:  he makes his appearance, and maintains his ancestral temple and the altars of the spirits of the land and grain, as presiding at all sacrifices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing thunder, being repeated, forms Ch&ecirc;n.  The superior man, in accordance with this is fearful and apprehensive, cultivates his virtue, and examines his faults.\n",
			"In the state indicated by Hsieh advantage will be found in the southwest.  If no further operations be called for, there will be good fortune in coming back to the old conditions.  If some operations be called for, there will be good fortune in the early conducting of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Hsieh we have the trigram expressive of peril going on to that expressive of movement.  By movement there is an escape from the peril: this is the meaning of Hsieh.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the state indicated byHsieh, advantage will be found in the southwest:  the movement thus intimated will win all.

			"Kuei Mei indicates that under the conditions which it denotes action will be evil, and in no wise advantageous.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Kuei Mei, the marrying away of a younger sister, the great and righteous relation between heaven and earth is suggested to us.  If heaven and earth were to have no intercommunication, things would not grow and flourish as they do.  The marriage of a younger sister is the end of her maidenhood and the beginning of her motherhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have in the hexagram the desire of pleasure and, on the ground of that, movement following.  The marrying away is of a younger sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny action will be evil: the places of the lines are not those appropriate to them.  It will be in no wise advantageous:  the weak third and fifth line are mounted on strong lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing the waters of a marsh and over it that for thunder form Kuei Mei.  The superior man, in accordance with this, having regard to the far-distant end, knows the mischief that may be done at the beginning.\n",
			"Hsiao Kuo indicates that in the circumstances which it implies there will be progress and attainment.  But it will be advantageous to be firm and correct.  What the name denotes may be done in small affairs, but not in great affairs.  It is like the notes that come down from a bird on the wing;  to descend is better that to ascend. There will be in this way great good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Hsiao Kuo we see the small lines exceeding the others, and giving the intimation of progress and attainment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch exceeding, in order to its being advantageous, must be associated with firmness and correctness:  that is, it must take place only according to the requirements of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weak lines are in the central places, and hence it is said that what the name denotes may be done in small affairs, and there will be good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the strong lines one is not in its proper place, and the other is not central, hence it is said that what the name denotes should not be done in great affairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the hexagram we have the symbol of a bird on the wing, and of the notes that come down from such a bird, for which it is better to descend than to ascend, thereby leading to great good fortune:  to ascend is contrary to what is reasonable in the case, while to descend is natural and right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing a hill and that for thunder above it form Hsiao Kuo.  The superior man, in accordance with this, in his conduct exceeds in humility, in mourning exceeds in sorrow, and in his expenditure exceeds in economy.\n",
			"F&ecirc;ng intimates progress and development.  When a king has reached the point which the name denotes there is no occasion to be anxious through fear of a change.  Let him be as the sun at noon.<br/>\n<br/>\nF&ecirc;ng has the signification of being great.  It is made up of the trigrams representing intelligence and movement directed by that intelligence.  It is thus that it has that signification.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe king has reached the condition denoted by F&ecirc;ng:  he has still to make it greater.  There is no occasion to be anxious.  Let him be as the sun at noon:  It is for him to cause his light to shine on all under the sky.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the sun has reached the meridian height, it begins to decline.  When the moon has become full, it begins to wane.  The interaction of heaven and earth is now vigorous and abundant, now dull and scanty, growing and diminishing according to the seasons.  How much more must it be so with the operations of men.  How much more also with the spiritual agency.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigrams representing thunder and lightning combine to form F&ecirc;ng.  The superior man, in accordance with this, decides cases of litigation, and apportions punishments with exactness.\n",
			"H&ecirc;ng indicates successful progress and no error in what it denotes.  But the advantage will come from being firm and correct; and movement in any direction whatever will be advantageous.<br/>\n<br/>\nH&ecirc;ng denotes long continuance. The strong trigram is above, and the weak one below; they are the symbols of thunder and wind, which are in mutual communication; they have the qualities of docility and motive force; their strong and weak lines all respond, each to the other:  these things are all found in H&ecirc;ng.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it is said that H&ecirc;ng indicates successful progress and no error in what it denotes; but the advantage will come from being firm and correct, this indicates that there must be long continuance in its way of operation.  The way of heaven and earth is to be long continued in their operation without stopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it is said that movement in any direction whatever will be advantageous, this implies that when the moving power is spent, it will begin again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sun and moon, realizing in themselves the course of Heaven, can perpetuate their shining.  The four seasons, by their changing and transforming, can perpetuate their production of things.  The sages persevere long in their course, and all under the sky are transformed and perfect.  When we look at what they continue doing long, the natural tendencies of heaven, earth, and all things can be seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing thunder and that for wind form H&ecirc;ng.

			"Chun indicates that in the case which it presupposes there will be great progress and success, and the advantage will come from being correct and firm.  But any movement in advance should not be lightly undertaken.  There will be advantage in appointing feudal princes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Chun we have the strong Ch'ien and the weak K'un commencing their intercourse, and difficulties arising.<br/>\n<br/>\nMovement in the midst of peril gives rise to great progress and success, through firm correctness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the action of the thunder and rain, which are symbols of Ch&ecirc;n and K'an, all between Heaven and Earth is filled up.  But the condition of the time is full of irregularity and obscurity.  Feudal princes should be established, but the feeling that rest and peace have been secured should not be indulged even then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing clouds and that representing thunder form Chun.  The superior man, in accordance with this, adjusts his measures of government as in sorting the threads of the warp and woof.\n",
			"K'an here repeated, shows the possession of sincerity, through which the mind is penetrating.  Action in accordance with this will be of high value.<br/>\n<br/>\nK'an repeated shows us one defile succeeding another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the nature of water; it flows on, without accumulating its volume so as to overflow;  it pursues its way through a dangerous defile, without losing its true nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat the mind is penetrating is indicated by the strong line in the center.  That action in accordance with this will be of high value tells us that advance will be followed by achievement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dangerous height of heaven cannot be ascended; the difficult places of the earth are mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds.  Kings and princes arrange, by means of such strengths, to maintain their territories.  Great indeed is the use of what is here taught about seasons of peril.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe representation of water flowing on continuously forms the repeated K'an.  The superior man, in accordance with this, maintains constantly the virtue of his heart and the integrity of his conduct, and practices the business of instruction.\n",

We have all regulations controlled by authority in its proper place.  We have free action proceeding from the central and correct position.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven and earth observe their regular terms, and we have the four seasons complete.  If rulers frame their measures according to the due regulations, the resources of the state suffer no injury, and the people receive no hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing a lake, and above it that for water, form Chieh.

In these circumstances, with firmness and correctness, there will be good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nChien denotes difficulty.  There is the trigram expressive of perilousness in front.  When one, seeing the peril, can arrest his steps in accordance with the significance of the lower trigram, is he not wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe language of Chien, that advantage and in the central place.  That there will be no advantage in the northeast, intimates that the way of dealing with the Kien state is exhausted.  That it will be advantageous to see the great man, intimates that advance will lead to achievement.

The superior man, in accordance with this, thinks of evil that may come, and beforehand guards against it.\n",
			"Looking at Ching, we think of how the site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no change.  The water of a well never disappears and never receives any great increase, and those who come and those who go can draw and enjoy the benefit.  If the drawing have nearly been accomplished, but before the rope has quite reached the water, the bucket is broken, this is evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the symbol of wood in the water and the raising of the water; which gives us the idea of a well.  A well supplies nourishment and is not itself exhausted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no change:  this is indicated by the central position of the strong lines in the second and fifth places.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe drawing is nearly  accomplished, but the rope has not yet reached the water of the well:  its service has not yet been accomplished.

The superior man, in accordance with this, eats and drinks, feasts and enjoys himself as if there were nothing else to employ him.\n",
			"In the state denoted by Ts'ui, the king will repair to his ancestral temple.  It will be advantageous also to meet with the great man; and then there will be progress and success, though the advantage must come through firm correctness.   The use of great victims will conduce to good fortune; and whatever direction movement is made, it will be advantageous.<br/>\n<br/>\nTs'ui indicates the condition of union, or being collected.

The superior man in accordance with this, when it is getting towards dark, enters his house and rests.\n",
			"In the condition denoted by K'un there may yet be progress and success.  For the firm and correct, the really great man, there will be good fortune.  He will fall into no error.  If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn K'un we see the strong lines covered and obscured by the weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have in it the attribute of perilousness going on to that of satisfaction.  Who is it but the superior man that, though straightened, still does not fail in making progress to his proper end.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the firm and correct, the really great man, there will be good fortune:  this is shown by the central positions of the strong lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he make speeches, his words cannot be made good:  to be fond of arguing or pleading is the way to be reduced to extremity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram representing a marsh, and below it that for a defile, which has drained the other dry so that there is no water in it, form K'un.

We have the strong lines in the center, and the weak lines on the outer edge of the two trigrams, indicating that in pleasure what is most advantageous is the maintenance of firm correctness.  Through this there will be found an accordance with the will of heaven, and a correspondence with the feelings of men.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen such pleasure goes before the people, and leads them on, they forget their toils; when it animates them in encountering difficulties, they forget the risk of death.  How great is the power of  this pleased satisfaction, stimulating in such a way the people.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo symbols representing the waters of a marsh, one over the other, form Tui.  The superior man, in accordance with this, encourages the conversation of friends and the stimulus of their common practice.\n",
