			"This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the hexagram is devotion, its image is the earth. It is the perfect complement of the Creative, the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does not combat the Creative but completes it. It represents nature in contrast to spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female maternal as against the male paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative, then it is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil. The result then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of evil to both.\n",
			"The idea of a turning point arises from the fact that after the dark lines have pushed all of the light lines upward and out of the hexagram, another light line returns to the hexagram from below. The time of darkness is past. The winter solstice brings the victory of light. This hexagram is linked with the eleventh month, the month of the solstice December January.\n",
			"This hexagram is made up of the trigrams Water and Earth, and thus it symbolizes the ground water stored up in the earth. In the same way military strength is stored up in the accumulation of the people, invisible in times of peace but always ready for use as a source of power. The attributes of the two trigrams are danger inside and the obedience  that must prevail outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are subordinate. This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the middle of one of the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather than the upper trigram, it represents not the ruler but the efficient general, who maintains obedience in the Army by his authority.\n",
			"The Chinese word for this hexagram has a range of meanings that is not exhausted by any single word of another language. The ancient explanations in the Book of Changes give as its first meaning, becoming great. What becomes great are the two strong lines growing into the hexagram from below, the light giving power expands with them. The meaning is then further extended to include the concept of approach, especially the approach of what is lower. Finally the meaning includes the attitude of condescension of a man in high position toward the people, and in general the setting to work on affairs. This hexagram is linked with the twelfth month January February, when after the winter solstice, the light power begins to ascend again.\n",
			"This hexagram is made up of the trigrams mountain, and earth. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative, the representative of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain that gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great and strong men. The earth stands above, although lowliness it's quality, and this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted, by being placed above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in lowly, simple people, they are lifted up by it.\n",
			"Here the sun has sunk under the earth and is therefore darkened. The name of the hexagram means literally wounding of the bright, hence the individual lines contain frequent references to wounding. The situation is the exact opposite of that in Progress. In the latter a wise man at the head of affairs has able helpers, and in company with them makes progress, here a man of dark nature is in a position of authority and brings harm to the wise and able man.\n",
			"The lower trigram represents wood, and the upper means the earth. Linked with this is the idea that wood in the earth grows upward. In contrast to the meaning of Progress, this ascent is associated with effort, just as a plant needs energy for ascent through the earth. That is why this hexagram, although it is connected with success, is associated with effort of the will. In Progress the emphasis is on expansion, Ascent indicates rather a vertical ascent direct rise from obscurity and lowliness to power and influence.\n",
			"The Receptive, which moves downward, stands above, the Creative, which moves upward, is below. Hence their influences meet and are in harmony, so that all living things bloom and prosper. This hexagram belongs to the first month February March, at which time the forces of nature prepare the new spring.\n",
			"The strong line in the fourth place, that of the leading official, meets with response and obedience from all the other lines, which are all weak. The attribute of the upper trigram, is movement, the attributes of the lower, are obedience and devotion. This begins a movement that meets with devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm, carrying all with it. Of great importance, furthermore, is the law of movement along the line of least resistance, which in this hexagram is enunciated as the law for natural events and for human life.\n",
			"The hexagram represents the eldest son, who seizes rule with energy and power. A yang line develops below two yin lines and presses upward forcibly. This movement is so violent that it arouses terror. It is symbolized by thunder, which bursts forth from the earth and by its shock causes fear and trembling.\n",
			"Here the movement goes out of the sphere of danger. The obstruction has been removed, the difficulties are being resolved. Deliverance is not yet achieved, it is just in its beginning, and the hexagram represents its various stages.\n",
			"Above we have the eldest son, and below, the youngest daughter. The man leads and the girl follows him in gladness. The picture is that of the entrance of the girl into her husband's house. In all, there are four hexagrams depicting the relationship between husband and wife. Influence, describes the attraction that a young couple have for each other, Duration, portrays the permanent relationships of marriage, Development reflects the protracted, ceremonious procedures attending the arrangement of a proper mariage, and Propriety shows a young girl under the guidance of an older man who marries her.\n",
			"While in the hexagram Excess, the strong lines preponderate and are within, inclosed between weak lines at the top and bottom, the present hexagram has weak lines preponderathough here again they are on the outside, the strong lines being within. This indeed is the basis of the exceptional situation indicated by the hexagram. When strong lines are outside, we have the Nourishment, Sincerity, neither represents and exceptional state. When strong elements within preponderate, they necessarily enforce their will. This creates struggle and exceptional conditions in general. But in the present hexagram it is the weak element that perforce must mediate with the outside world. If a man occupies a position of authority for which he is by nature really inadequate, extraordinary prudence is necessary.\n",
			"Thunder is movement, Fire is flame, whose attribute is clarity. Clarity within, movement without, this produces greatness and abundance. The hexagram pictures a period of advanced culture. However, the fact that development has reached a peak suggests that this extraordinary condition of abundance cannot be maintained permanently.\n",
			"The strong trigram is above, the weak trigram below. This hexagram is the inverse of Influence, here we have union as an enduring condition. The two images are thunder and wind, which are likewise constantly paired phenomena. The lower trigram indicates gentleness within, the upper, movement without.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the sphere of social relationships, the hexagram represents the institution of marriage as the enduring union of the sexes. During courtship the young man subordinates himself to the girl, but in marriage, which is represented by the coming together of the eldest son and the eldest daughter, the husband is the directing and moving force outside, while the wife, inside, is gentle and submissive.\n",
			"The great lines, that is, the light, strong lines, are powerful. Four light lines have entered the hexagram from below and are mounting an ascent. The upper trigram is Thunder, producing movement, the lower is the Heaven which is strong. The union of movement and strength gives the meaning of Power. The hexagram is linked with the second month March April.\n",
			"The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they can, as for example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together. Symbolically this connotes union and the laws that regulate it. The same idea is suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines hold together because they are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position, a man who is their center of the union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality in turn holds together with the others, finding in them the complement of his own nature.\n",
			"The name of the hexagram really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstruction as it sprouts out of the earth, hence the meaning, difficulty. The hexagram indicates the way in which heaven and earth bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram is thunder, its motion is upward and its image is arouse. The upper trigram stands for water, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion, thunder and rain fill the air. But the chaos clears up. While danger sinks, the upward movement eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings release from tension, and all things breathe freely again.\n",
			"This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram Water. It is one of the eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram means a plunging in, a yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram is also the middle son. The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus develops. As an image it represents water, the water that comes from above and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving rise to all life on earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn man's world represents the heart, the soul locked up within the body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark, that is, reason. The name of the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning, repetition of danger. Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an objective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means either foolhardiness or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger, it is a situation in which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine, and, like the water, he can escape if he behaves correctly.\n",
			"A lake occupies a limited space. When more water comes into it, it overflows. Therefore limits must be set for the water. The image shows water below and water above, with the firmament between them as a limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chinese word for limitation really denotes the joints that divide a bamboo stalk. In relation to ordinary life it means the thrift that sets fixed limits upon expenditures. In relation to the moral sphere it means the fixed limits that the superior man sets upon his actions the limits of loyalty and disinterestedness.\n",
			"The hexagram pictures a dangerous abyss lying before us and a steep, inaccessible mountain rising behind us. We are surrounded by obstacles, at the same time, since the mountain has the attribute of stillness, there is implicit a hint as to how we can extricate ourselves. The hexagram represents obstructions that appear in the course of time but that can and should be overcome. Therefore all the instruction given is directed to overcoming them.\n",
			"This hexagram is the evolution of Peace. The transition from chaos to order is completed, and everything is in its proper place even in particulars. The strong lines are in the strong places, the weak lines in the weak places. This is a very favorable outlook, yet it gives reason for thought. For it is just when perfect equilibrium has been reached that any movement may cause order to revert to chaos. The one strong line that has moved to the top, thus effecting complete order in details, is followed by the other lines. Each moving according to its nature, and thus suddenly there arises again the hexagram Stagnation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence the present hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax, which necessitate the utmost caution.\n",
			"Wood is below, water above. The wood goes down into the earth to bring up water. The image derives from the pole and bucket well of ancient China. The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were made of clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled up from the Well. The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift water out of the earth by means of their fibers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Reserve from which water is drawn conveys the further idea of an inexhaustible dispensing of Nourishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hexagram and Culture are the only two in the Book of Changes that represent concrete, man made objects.\n",
			"All beings have need of Nourishment from above. But the gift of food comes in its own time, and for this one must wait. This hexagram shows the clouds in the heavens, giving rain to refresh all that grows and to provide mankind with food and drink. The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it come, we have to wait for it. The idea of delay is further suggested by the attributes of the two trigrams, strength within, danger in front. Strength in the face of danger does not plunge ahead but delays, whereas weakness in the face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.\n",
			"This hexagram is related in form and meaning to Union. In the latter, water is over the earth, here a lake is over the earth. But since the lake is a place where water collects, the idea of accumulation is even more strongly expressed here than in the other hexagram. The same idea also arises from the fact that in the present case it is two strong lines the fourth and the fifth that bring about the gather together, whereas in the former case one strong line the fifth stands in the midst of weak lines.\n",
			"The trigram Lake, whose attribute is gladness, is above, and Thunder which has the attribute of movement, is below. Joy in movement induces pursuit. Lake is the youngest daughter, while Thunder is the eldest son. An older man defers to a young girl and shows her consideration. By this he moves her to follow him.\n",
			"The lake is above, water below, the lake is empty, dried up. Exhaustion is expressed in yet another way, at the top, a dark line is holding down two light line, below, a light line is hemmed in between two dark ones. The upper trigram belongs to the principle of darkness, the lower to the principle of light. Thus everywhere superior men are oppressed and held in restraint by inferior men.\n",
			"This hexagram, like is one of the eight formed by doubling of a trigram. The trigram denotes the youngest daughter, it is symbolized by the smiling lake, and its attribute is joyousness. Contrary to appearances, it is not the yielding quality of the top line that accounts for pleasure here. The attribute of the yielding or dark principle is not joy but melancholy. However, joy is indicated by the fact that there are two strong lines within, expressing themselves through the medium of gentleness.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue pleasure, therefore, rests on firmness and strength within, manifesting itself outwardly as yielding and gentle.\n",
			"The name of the hexagram means universal, general, and in a figurative sense to influence, to stimulate. The upper trigram is the Lake, the lower is the Mountain. By its persistent, quiet influence, the lower, rigid trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds to this stimulation cheerfully and joyously. the lower trigram, is the youngest son, the upper, is the youngest daughter. Thus the universal mutual attraction between the sexes is represented. In courtship, the masculine principle must seize the initiative and place itself below the feminine principle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as the first part of book one, begins with the hexagrams of heaven and earth, the foundations of all that exists, the second part begins with the hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the foundations of all social relationships.\n",
			"The Chinese character for this hexagram means in its original sense an animal's pelt, which is changed in the course of the year by molting. From this word is carried over to apply to the moltings in political life, the great revolutions connected with changes of governments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two trigrams making up the hexagram are the same two that appear in Opposition, that is, the two younger daughters, Lake and Fire. But while there the elder of the two daughters is above, and what results is essentially only an opposition of tendencies, here the younger daughter is above. The influences are in actual conflict, and the forces combat each other like fire and water lake, each trying to destroy the other. Hence the idea of revolution.\n",
			"This hexagram consists of four strong lines inside and two weak lines outside. When the strong are outside and the weak inside, all is well and there is nothing but surplus, nothing extraordinary in the situation. Here, however, the opposite is the case. The hexagram represents a beam that is thick and heavy in the middle but too weak at the ends. This is a condition that cannot last, it must be changed, must pass, or misfortune will result.\n",
			"This hexagram signifies on the one hand a breakthrough after a long accumulation of tension, as a swollen river breaks through its dikes, or in the manner of a cloudburst. On the other hand, applied to human conditions, it refers to the time when inferior people gradually begin to disappear. Their influence is on the wane, as a result of resolution and action, a change in conditions occurs, a break through. The hexagram is linked with the third month April May.\n",
			"The dark lines are about to mount upward and overthrow the last firm, light line by exerting a disintegrating influence on it. The inferior, dark forces overcome what is superior and strong, not by direct means, but by undermining it gradually and imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lines of the hexagram present the image of a house, the top line being the roof, and because the roof is being shattered the house collapses. The hexagram belongs to the ninth month October November. The yin power pushes up ever more powerfully and is about to supplant the yang power altogether.\n",
			"This hexagram is a picture of an open mouth, above and below are the firm lines of the lips, and between them the opening. Starting with the mouth, through which we take food for Nourishment, the thought leads to Nourishment itself. Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented in the three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent Nourishment and care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.\n",
			"In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two different ways. The image of the upper trigram is the mountain, that of the lower is water. The spring rising at the foot of the mountain is the image of inexperienced youth. Stillness is the attribute of the upper trigram, that of the lower is the abyss. Stopping in perplexity on the brink of a dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of youth.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the two trigrams also show the way of overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something that of necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its progress, and success is attained.\n",
			"This hexagram represents a decrease of the lower trigram in favor of the upper, because the third line, originally strong, has moved up to the top, and the top line, originally weak, has replaced it. What is below is decreased to the benefit of what is above. This is out and out decrease. If the foundations of a building are decreased in strength and the upper walls are strengthened, the whole structure loses its stability. Likewise, a decrease in the prosperity of the people in favor of the government is out and out decrease. And the entire theme of the hexagram is directed to showing how this shift of wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth in the nation and its lower classes to fail.\n",
			"The image of this hexagram is the mountain, the youngest son of heaven and earth. The male principle is at the top because it strives upward by nature, the female principle is below, since the direction of its movement has come to its normal end.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the problem of achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring quiet to the heart. While Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing away of all movement in nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polarity that always posits movement as its complement. Possibly the words of the text embody directions for the practice of meditation.\n",
			"This hexagram shows a fire that breaks out of the secret depths of the earth and, blazing up, illuminates and beautifies the mountain, the heavenly heights. Grace, beauty of form is necessary in any union if it is to be well ordered and pleasing rather than disordered and chaotic.\n",
			"The Chinese character represents a bowl in whose contents worms are breeding. This means decay, it is come about because the gentle indifference in the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia of the upper, and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the conditions embody a demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram is not simply what has been spoiled but repair.\n",
			"The Creative is tamed by Meditation. This produces great power, a situation in contrast to that of Restraint, in which the Creative is tamed by Faith alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four strong lines are restrained by two weak lines, in addition to a minister, there is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is far stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the concept discipline. Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of union, the trigram mountain, which holds the trigram heaven still, gives the idea of discipline in the sense of holding back, the third idea is that of discipline in the sense of caring for and nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, which represents the sage.\n",
			"The hexagram represents the sun rising over the earth. It is therefore the symbol of rapid, easy progress, which at the same time means ever widening expansion and clarity.\n",
			"This hexagram represents an open mouth, Nourishment, with an obstruction in the fourth place between the teeth. As a result the lips cannot meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature. Energetic bitting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the lips, the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Conflict, which refers to civil suits.\n",
			"This hexagram indicates a time when the transition from chaos to order is not yet completed. The change is indeed prepared for, since all the lines in the upper trigram are in relation to those in the lower. However, they are not yet in their places. While the preceding hexagram offers an analogy to autumn, which forms the transition from summer to winter, this hexagram presents a parallel to spring, which leads out of winter's stagnation into the fruitful time of summer. With this hopeful outlook the Book of Changes come to its close.\n",
			"This hexagram is composed of the trigram Fire above, which burns upward, and Lake below, which seeps downward. These two movements are in direct contrast. Furthermore, is the second daughter and the youngest daughter, and although they live in the same house they belong to different men, hence their wills are not the same but are divergently directed.\n",
			"The mountain stands still, above it fire flames up and does not tarry. Therefore the two trigrams do not stay together. Strange lands and separation are the Wanderer's lot.\n",
			"This hexagram is another double sign. The trigram means to cling to something, and also brightness. A dark line clings to two light lines, one above and one below, the image of an empty space between two strong lines, whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram represents the middle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central line of the Receptive, and thus develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire has no definite form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright. As water pours down from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While means the soul shut within the body, stands for nature in its radiance.\n",
			"The six lines construct the image of a cauldron, at the bottom are the legs, over them the belly, then come the ears handles, and at the top the carrying rings. At the same time, the image suggests the idea of Nourishment. The cauldron, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held the cooked viands in the temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The heads of the family served the food from the cauldron into the bowls of the guests.<br/>\n<br/>\nReserve likewise has the secondary meaning of giving Nourishment, but rather more in relation to the people. The cauldron, as a utensil pertaining to a refined culture, suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men, which redounded to the benefit of the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hexagram and Reserve are the only two in the Book of Changes that represent concrete, man made objects. Yet here too the thought has its abstract connotation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWood below, and Fire, above. Thus together they stand for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea of preparing food.\n",
			"The fire in heaven above shines far, and all things stand out in the light and become manifest. The weak fifth line occupies the place of honor and all the strong lines are in accord with it. All things come to the man who is modest and kind in a high position.\n",
			"A slight variation of tonal stress gives the Chinese name for this hexagram a double meaning. It means both contemplation and being seen, in the sense of being an example. These ideas are suggested by the fact that the hexagram can be understood as picturing a type of tower characteristic of ancient China. A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country, at the same time, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be seen for miles around. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who's contemplation of the law of heaven above him and the ways of the people below, and who, by means of good government, sets a lofty example to the masses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hexagram is linked with the eight month September October. The light giving power retreats and the dark power is again on the increase. However, this aspect is not material in the interpretation of the hexagram as a whole.\n",
			"The idea of increase is expressed in the fact that the strong lowest line of the upper trigram has sunk down and taken its place under the lower trigram. This conception also expresses the fundamental idea on which the Book of Changes is based. To rule truly is to serve.<br/>\n<br/>\nA sacrifice of the higher element that produces an increase of the lower is called an out and out increase. It indicates the spirit that alone has power to help the world.\n",
			"Wind blowing over water disperses it, dissolving it into foam and mist. This suggests that when a man's vital energy is dammed up within him, indicated as a danger by the attribute of the lower trigram, gentleness serves to break up and dissolve the blockage.\n",
			"The wind blows over the lake and stirs the surface of the water. Thus visible effects of the invisible manifest themselves. The hexagram consists of firm lines above and below, while it is open in the center. This indicates a heart free of prejudices and therefore open to truth. On the other hand, each of the two trigrams has a firm line in the middle, this indicates the force of sincerity in the influences they present.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attributes of the two trigrams are. above, gentleness, forbearance toward inferiors, below, joyousness in obeying superiors. Such conditions create the basis of a mutual confidence that makes achievements possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character of truth is actually the picture of a bird's foot over a fledgling. It suggests the idea of brooding. An egg is hollow. The light giving power must work to quicken it from outside, but there must be a germ of life within, if life is to be awakened. Far reaching speculations can be linked with these ideas.\n",
			"This hexagram is made up of wood, penetration above, i.e., without, and mountain, stillness below, i.e., within. A tree on a mountain develops slowly according to the law of its being and consequently stands firmly rooted. This gives the idea of a development that proceeds gradually, step by step. The attributes of the trigrams also point to this, within is tranquillity, which guards against precipitate actions, and without is penetration, which makes development and progress possible.\n",
			"The hexagram represents the laws obtaining within the family. The strong line at the top represents the father, the lowest the son. The strong line in the fifth place represents the husband, the yielding second line the wife. On the other hand, the two strong lines in the fifth and the third place represent two brothers, and the two weak lines correlated with them in the fourth and the second place stand for their respective wives. Thus all the connections and relationships within the family are in order. Each individual line has the character according with its place. The fact that a strong line occupies the sixth place where a weak line might be expected indicates very clearly the strong leadership that must come from the head of the family. The line is to be considered here not in its quality as the sixth but in its quality as the top line. The family shows the laws operative within the household that, transferred to outside life, keep the state and the world in order. The influence that goes out from within the family is represented by the symbol of the wind created by fire.\n",
			"Faith is one of the eight doubled trigrams. It is the eldest daughter and symbolizes wind or wood, it has for its attribute gentleness, which nonetheless penetrates like the wind or like growing wood with its roots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dark principle, in itself rigid and immovable, is dissolved by the penetrating light principle, to which it subordinates itself in faith. In nature, it is the wind that disperses the gathered clouds, leaving the sky clear and serene. In human life it is penetrating clarity of judgment that thwarts all dark hidden motives. In the life of the community it is the powerful influence of a great personality that uncovers and breaks up those intrigues which shun the light of day.\n",
			"This hexagram means the force of the small, the power of the shadowy, that restrains, tames, impedes. A weak line in the fourth place, that of the minister, holds the five strong lines in check. In the Image it is the wind blowing across the sky. The wind restrains the clouds, the rising breath of the Creative, and makes them grow dense, but as yet is not strong enough to turn them to rain. The hexagram presents a configuration of circumstances in which a strong element is temporarily held in leash by a weak element. It is only through gentleness that this can have a successful outcome.\n",
			"This hexagram is the opposite of Peace. Heaven is above, drawing farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the depths. The Creative powers are not in relation. It is a time of stagnation and decline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month August September, when the year has passed its zenith and autumnal decay is setting in.\n",
			"Heaven is above, movement is below. The lower trigram is under the influence of the strong line it has received form above, from heaven. When, in accord with this, movement follows the law of heaven, man is innocent and without guile. His mind is natural and true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been lost. Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate nature. Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought in part goes somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea of the fundamental or unexpected.\n",
			"The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement, the lower trigram, water, in accordance with its nature tends downward. Thus the two halves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attribute of the Heaven is strength, that of Water is danger, guile. Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nA third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the combination of deep cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A person of this character will certainly be quarrelsome.\n",
			"The name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of conducting oneself. Heaven, the father, is above, and Lake, the youngest daughter, is below. This shows the difference between high and low, upon which composure correct social conduct, depends. On the other hand the Chineses word for this hexagram, literally means treading upon something. The small and cheerful Lake treads upon the large and strong Heaven. The direction of movement of the two primary trigrams is upward. The fact that the strong treads on the weak is not mentioned in the Book of Changes, because it is taken for granted. For the weak to take a stand against the strong is not dangerous here, because it happens in good humor and without presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but takes it all in good part.\n",
			"The power of the dark is ascending. The light retreats to security, so that the dark cannot encroach upon it. This retreat is a matter not of man's will but of natural law. Therefore in this case withdrawal is proper, it is the correct way to behave in order not to exhaust one's forces.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the calendar this hexagram is linked with the sixth month July August, in which the forces of winter are already showing their influence.\n",
			"The image of the upper trigram is heaven, and that of the lower, is fire. It is the nature of fire to flame up to the heaven. This gives the idea of fellowship, it is the second line that by virtue of its central character, unites the five strong lines around it. This hexagram forms a complement to The Army. In the latter, danger is within and discipline without, the character of a warlike army, which, in order to hold together, needs one strong man among the many who are weak. Here, clarity is within and strength without, the character of a peaceful union of men, which, in order to hold together, needs one yielding nature among many firm persons.\n",
			"This hexagram indicates a situation in which the principle of darkness, after having been eliminated, furtively and unexpectedly obtrudes again from within and below. Of its own accord the female principle comes to meet the male. It is an unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must understand and promptly prevent the possible consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hexagram is linked with the fifth month June July, because at the summer solstice the principle of darkness gradually becomes ascendant again.\n",
			"The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines stand for the primal power, which is light giving, active, strong, and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the Creative action of the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens and develops their higher nature.\n",

			"The earth's condition is receptive devotion.<br/>\nThus the superior man who has breadth of character<br/>\nCarries the outer world.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good and evil, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to support and to bear with people and things.\n",
			"Thunder within the earth.<br/>\nThe image of The Return.<br/>\nThus the kings of antiquity closed the passes<br/>\nAt the time of solstice.<br/>\nMerchants and strangers did not go about,<br/>\nAnd the ruler<br/>\nDid not travel through the provinces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe winter solstice has always been celebrated in China as the resting time of the year, a custom that survives in the time of rest observed at the new year. In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, arouse, is still underground. Movement is just at its beginning, therefore it must be strengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being used prematurely. This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing itself to be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations. The return of health after illness, the return of understanding after an estrangement. everything must be treated tenderly and with care at the beginning, so that the return may lead to a flowering.\n",
			"In the middle of the earth is water.<br/>\nThe image of the Army.<br/>\nThus the superior man increases his masses<br/>\nBy generosity toward the people.<br/>\n<br/>\nGround water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way the military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When danger threatens, every peasant becomes a soldier, when the war ends, he goes back to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people economically strong can be an important in military power. Such power must therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people and by humane government. Only when there is this invisible bond between government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their government as ground water is sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a victorious war.\n",
			"The earth above the lake.<br/>\nThe image of Approach.<br/>\nThus the superior man is inexhaustible<br/>\nIn his will to teach,<br/>\nAnd without limits<br/>\nIn his tolerance and protection of the people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe earth borders upon the lake from above. This symbolizes the approach and condescension of the man of higher position to those beneath him. The two parts of the image indicate what his attitude toward these people will be. Just as the lake is inexhaustible in depth, so the sage is inexhaustible in his readiness to teach mankind, and just as the earth is boundlessly wide, sustaining and caring for all creatures on it, so the sage sustains and cares for all people and excludes no part of humanity.\n",
			"Within the earth, a mountain.<br/>\nThe image of Modesty.<br/>\nThus the superior man reduces that which is too much,<br/>\nAnd augments that which is too little.<br/>\nHe weighs things and makes them equal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible to the eye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain. Thus high and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here an effect that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems easy of accomplishment and self evident, is used as the image of modesty. The superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the world, he equalizes the extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby creates just and equable conditions.\n",
			"The light has sunk into the earth.<br/>\nThe image of Delusion.<br/>\nThus does the superior man live with the great mass.<br/>\nHe veils his light, yet still shines.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a time of darkness it is essential to be cautious and reserved. One should not needlessly awaken overwhelming enmity by inconsiderate behavior. In such times one ought not to fall in with the practices of others, neither should one drag them censoriously into the light. In social intercourse one should not try to be all knowing. One should let many things pass, without being duped.\n",
			"Within the earth, wood grows.<br/>\nThe image of Ascent.<br/>\nThus the superior man of devoted character<br/>\nHeaps up small things<br/>\nIn order to achieve something high and great.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdapting itself to obstacles and bending around them, wood in the earth grows upward without haste and without rest. Thus too the superior man is devoted in character and never pauses in his progress.\n",
			"Heaven and earth unite, the image of Peace.<br/>\nThus the ruler<br/>\nDivides and completes the course of heaven and earth,<br/>\nAnd so aids the people.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences, producing a time of universal flowering and prosperity. This stream of energy must be regulated by the ruler of men. It is done by a process of division. Thus men divide the uniform flow of time into the seasons, according to the succession of natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the points of the compass. In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion of phenomena is bounded and controlled. One the other hand, nature must be furthered in her productiveness. This is done by adjusting the products to the right time and the right place, which increases the natural yield. This controlling and furthering activity of man in his relation to nature is the work on nature that rewards him.\n",
			"Thunder comes resounding out of the earth.<br/>\nThe image of Enthusiasm.<br/>\nThus the ancient kings made music<br/>\nIn order to honor merit,<br/>\nAnd offered it with splendor<br/>\nTo the Supreme Deity,<br/>\nInviting their ancestors to be present.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen, at the beginning of summer, thunder, electrical energy, comes rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make themselves felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart and to loosen the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart expresses itself involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic movement of the body. From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the invisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified mankind.<br/>\n<br/>\nRulers have made use of this natural taste for music, they elevated and regulated it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed to purify the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of heroes and thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the temple men drew near to God with music and pantomimes out of this later the theater developed. Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was united with the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the ancestors. The ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests of the Ruler of Heaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions. This uniting of the human past with the Divinity in solemn moments of religious inspiration established the bond between God and man. The ruler who revered the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven, in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical contact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese ideas are the final summation of Chinese culture. Confucius has said of the great sacrifice at which these rites were performed. He who could wholly comprehend this sacrifice could rule the world as though it were spinning on his hand.\n",
			"Thunder repeated, the image of Arouse.<br/>\nThus in fear and trembling<br/>\nThe superior man sets his life in order<br/>\nAnd examines himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shock of continuing thunder brings fear and trembling. The superior man is always filled with reverence at the manifestation of God, he sets his life in order and searches his heart, lest it harbor any secret opposition to the will of God. Thus reverence is the foundation of true culture.\n",
			"Thunder and rain set in.<br/>\nThe image of Deliverance.<br/>\nThus the superior man pardons mistakes<br/>\nAnd forgives misdeeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nA thunderstorm has the effect of clearing the air, the superior man produces a similar effect when dealing with mistakes and sins of men that induce a condition of tension. Through clarity he brings deliverance. However, when failings come to light, he does not dwell on them, he simply passes over mistakes, the unintentional transgressions, just as thunder dies away. He forgives misdeeds, the intentional transgressions, just as water washes everything clean.\n",
			"Thunder over the lake.<br/>\nThe image of Propriety.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nUnderstands the transitory<br/>\nIn the light of the eternity of the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThunder stirs the water of the lake, which follows it in shimmering waves. This symbolizes the girl who follows the man of her choice. But every relationship between individuals bears within it the danger that wrong turns may be taken, leading to endless misunderstandings and disagreements. Therefore it is necessary constantly to remain mindful of the end. If we permit ourselves to drift along, we come together and are parted again as the day may determine. If on the other hand a man fixes his mind on an end that endures, he will succeed in avoiding the reefs that confront the closer relationships of people.\n",
			"Thunder on the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of Surplus.<br/>\nThus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.<br/>\nIn bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.<br/>\nIn his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.<br/>\n<br/>\nThunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the plain. In the mountains, thunder seems much nearer, outside the mountains, it is less audible than the thunder of an ordinary storm. Thus the superior man derives an imperative from this image. he must always fix his eyes more closely and more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though this might make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is exceptionally conscientious in his actions. In bereavement emotion means more to him than ceremoniousness. In all his personal expenditures he is extremely simple and unpretentious. In comparison with the man of the masses, all this makes him stand out as exceptional. But the essential significance of his attitude lies in the fact that in external matters he is on the side of the lowly.\n",
			"Both thunder and lightning come.<br/>\nThe image of Abundance.<br/>\nThus the superior man decides lawsuits<br/>\nAnd carries out punishments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hexagram has a certain connection with Resolution, in which thunder and lightning similarly appear together, but in the reverse order. In Resolution, laws are laid down, here they are applied and enforced. Clarity within makes it possible to investigate the facts exactly, and shock without ensures a strict and precise carrying out of punishments.\n",
			"Thunder and wind, the image of Duration.<br/>\nThus the superior man stands firm<br/>\nAnd does not change has direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThunder rolls, and the wind blows, both are examples of extreme mobility and so are seemingly the very opposite of duration, but the laws governing their appearance and subsidence, their coming and going, endure. In the same way the independence of the superior man is not based on rigidity and immobility of character. He always keeps abreast of the time and changes with it. What endures is the unswerving directive, the inner law of his being, which determines all his actions.\n",
			"Thunder in heaven above.<br/>\nThe image of Power.<br/>\nThus the superior man does not tread upon paths<br/>\nThat do not accord with established order.<br/>\n<br/>\nThunder, electrical energy, mounts upward in the spring. The direction of this movement is in harmony with that of the movement of heaven. It is therefore a movement in accord with heaven, producing great power. However, true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right. Therefore in times of great power the superior man avoids doing anything that is not in harmony with the established order.\n",
			"On the earth is water.<br/>\nThe image of Union.<br/>\nThus the kings of antiquity<br/>\nBestowed the different states as fiefs<br/>\nAnd cultivated friendly relations<br/>\nWith the feudal lords.<br/>\n<br/>\nWater fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to it. The social organization of ancient China was based on this principle of the union of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite with water, because all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too should human society hold together through a community of interests that allows each individual to feel himself a member of a whole. The central power of a social organization must see to it that every member finds that his true interest lies in union with it, as was the case in the paternal relationship between king and vassals in ancient China.\n",
			"Clouds and thunder.<br/>\nThe image of Difficulty.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nBrings order out of chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nClouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative lines, this means that in the chaos of difficulty, order is already implicit. So too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's place in the infinity of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite.\n",
			"Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its foal.<br/>\nThe image of danger repeated.<br/>\nThus the superior man walks in lasting virtue<br/>\nAnd carries on the business of teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nWater reaches its goal by flowing continually. It fills up every depression before it flows on. The superior man follows its example, he is concerned that goodness should be an established attribute of character rather than an accidental and isolated occurrence. So likewise in teaching others everything depends on consistency, for it is only through repetition that the pupil makes the material his own.\n",
			"Water over lake, the image of Limitation.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nCreates number and measure,<br/>\nAnd examines the nature of virtue and correct conduct.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lake is something limited. Water is inexhaustible. A lake can contain only a definite amount of the infinite quantity of water, this is its peculiarity. In human life too the individual achieves significance through discrimination and the setting of limits. Therefore what concerns us here is the problem of clearly defining these discriminations, which are, so to speak, the backbone of morality. Unlimited possibilities are not suited to man, if they existed, his life would only dissolve in the boundless. To become strong, a man's life needs the limitations ordained by duty and voluntarily accepted. The individual attains significance as a free spirit only by surrounding himself with these limitations and by determining for himself what his duty is.\n",
			"Water on the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of Obstruction.<br/>\nThus the superior man turns his attention to himself<br/>\nAnd molds his character.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifficulties and obstructions throw a man back upon himself. While the inferior man seeks to put the blame on other persons, bewailing his fate, the superior man seeks the error within himself, and through this introspection the external obstacle becomes for him an occasion for inner enrichment and education.\n",
			"Water over fire, the image of the condition<br/>\nIn After Completion.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nTakes thought of misfortune<br/>\nAnd arms himself against it in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen water in a kettle hangs over fire, the two elements stand in relation and thus generate energy cf. the production of steam. But the resulting tension demands caution. If the water boils over, the fire is extinguished an its energy is lost. If the heat is too great, the water evaporates into the air. These elements here brought in to relation and thus generating energy are by nature hostile to each other. Only the most extreme caution can prevent damage. In life too there are junctures when all forces are in balance and work in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best of order. In such times only the sage recognizes the moments that bode danger and knows how to banish it by means of timely precautions.\n",
			"Water over wood, the image of a Reserve.<br/>\nThus the superior man encourages the people at their work,<br/>\nAnd exhorts them to help one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trigram wood, is below, and the trigram water, is above it. Wood sucks water upward. Just as wood as an organism imitates the action of a well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior man organizes human society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts co-operate for the benefit of the whole.\n",
			"Clouds rise up to heaven.<br/>\nThe image of Delay.<br/>\nThus the superior man eats and drinks,<br/>\nIs joyous and of good cheer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will rain. There is nothing to do but to wait until after the rain falls. It is the same in life when destiny is at work. We should not worry and seek to shape the future by interfering in things before the time is ripe. We should quietly fortify the body with food and drink and the mind with gladness and good cheer. Fate comes when it will, and thus we are ready.\n",
			"Over the earth, the lake.<br/>\nThe image of Accumulation.<br/>\nThus the superior man renews his weapons<br/>\nIn order to meet the unforeseen.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the water in the lake gathers until it rises above the earth, there is danger of a break through. Precautions must be taken to prevent this. Similarly where men gather together in great numbers, strife is likely to arise, where possessions are collected, robbery is likely to occur. Thus in the time of Accumulation we must arm promptly to ward off the unexpected. Human woes usually come as a result of unexpected events against which we are not forearmed. If we are prepared, they can be prevented.\n",
			"Thunder in the middle of the lake.<br/>\nThe image of Pursuit.<br/>\nThus the superior man at nightfall<br/>\nGoes indoors for rest and recuperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and rests. Here it is the thunder in the middle of the lake that serves as the image, thunder in its winter rest, not thunder in motion. The idea of pursuit in the sense of adaptation to the demands of the time grows out of this image. Thunder in the middle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest. Similarly, a superior man, after being tirelessly active all day, allows himself rest and recuperation at night. No situation can become favorable until one is able to adapt to it and does not wear himself out with mistaken resistance.\n",
			"There is no water in the lake.<br/>\nThe image of Oppression.<br/>\nThus the superior man stakes his life<br/>\nOn pursuit his will.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the water has flowed out below, the lake must dry up and become exhausted. That is fate. This symbolizes an adverse fate in human life. In such times there is nothing a man can do but acquiesce in his fate and remain true to himself. This concerns the deepest stratum of his being, for this alone is superior to all external fate.\n",
			"Lakes resting one on the other.<br/>\nThe image of Pleasure.<br/>\nThus the superior man joins with his friends<br/>\nFor discussion and practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lake evaporates upward and thus gradually dries up, but when two lakes are joined they do not dry up so readily, for one replenishes the other. It is the same in the field of knowledge. Knowledge should be a refreshing and vitalizing force. It becomes so only through stimulating intercourse with congenial friends with whom one holds discussion and practices application of the truths of life. In this way learning becomes many sided and takes on a cheerful lightness, whereas there is always something ponderous and one sided about the learning of the self taught.\n",
			"A lake on the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of influence.<br/>\nThus the superior man encourages people to approach him<br/>\nBy his readiness to receive them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the moisture from the lake. It has this advantage because its summit does not jut out as a peak but is sunken. The image counsels that the mind should be kept humble and free, so that it may remain receptive to good advice. People soon give up counseling a man who thinks that he knows everything better than anyone else.\n",
			"Fire in the lake. The image of Revolution.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nSets the calendar in order<br/>\nAnd makes the seasons clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nFire below and the lake above combat and destroy each other. So too in the course of the year a combat takes place between the forces of light and the forces of darkness, eventuating in the revolution of the seasons, and man is able to adjust himself in advance to the demands of the different times.\n",
			"The lake rises above the trees.<br/>\nThe image of Excess.<br/>\nThus the superior man, when he stands alone,<br/>\nIs unconcerned,<br/>\nAnd if he has to renounce the world,<br/>\nHe is undaunted.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times when the lake rises over the treetops. But such conditions are temporary. The two trigrams indicate the attitude proper to such exceptional times. the symbol of the trigram is the tree, which stands firm even though it stands alone, and the attribute of is joyousness, which remains undaunted even if it must renounce the world.\n",
			"The lake has risen up to heaven.<br/>\nThe image of Breakthrough.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nDispenses riches downward<br/>\nAnd refrains from resting on his virtue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the water of a lake has risen up to heaven, there is reason to fear a cloudburst. Taking this as a warning, the superior man forestalls a violent collapse. If a man were to pile up riches for himself alone, without considering others, he would certainly experience a collapse. If a man were to pile up riches for himself alone, without considering others, he would certainly experience a collapse. For all gathering is followed by dispersion. Therefore the superior man begins to distribute while he is accumulating. In the same way, in developing his character he takes care not to become hardened in obstinacy but to remain receptive to impressions by help of strict and continuous self examination.\n",
			"The mountain rests on the earth.<br/>\nThe image of Disintegration.<br/>\nThus those above can ensure their position<br/>\nOnly by giving generously to those below.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mountain rests on the earth. When it is steep and narrow, lacking a broad base, it must topple over. Its position is strong only when it rises out of the earth broad and great, not proud and steep. So likewise those who rule rest on the broad foundation of the people. They too should be generous and benevolent, like the earth that carries all. Then they will make their position as secure as a mountain is in its tranquillity.\n",
			"At the foot of the mountain, thunder.<br/>\nThe image of providing Nourishment.<br/>\nThus the superior man is careful of his words<br/>\nAnd temperate in eating and drinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod comes forth in the sign of arouse. when in the spring the life forces stir again, all things comes into being anew. He brings to perfection in the sign of Meditation. thus in the early spring, when the seeds fall to earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing Nourishment through movement and tranquillity. The superior man takes it as a pattern for the Nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words are a movement going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements from without inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity. For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding its proper measure. Thus character is cultivated.\n",
			"A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of youth.<br/>\nThus the superior man fosters his character<br/>\nBy thoroughness in all that he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nA spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling up all the hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed by thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily fills up all gaps and so flows onward.\n",
			"At the foot of the mountain, the lake.<br/>\nThe image of Decrease.<br/>\nThus the superior man controls his anger<br/>\nAnd restrains his instincts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture. The mountain stands as the symbol of stubborn strength that can harden into anger. The lake is the symbol of unchecked gaiety that can develop into passionate drives at the expense of the life forces. Therefore decrease is necessary, anger must be decreased by meditation, the instincts must be curbed by restriction. By this decrease of the lower powers of the psyche, the higher aspects of the soul are enriched.\n",
			"Mountains standing close together.<br/>\nThe image of Meditation.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nDoes not permit his thoughts<br/>\nTo go beyond his situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heart thinks constantly. This cannot be changed, but the movements of the heart that is, a man's thoughts should restrict themselves to the immediate situation. All thinking that goes beyond this only makes the heart sore.\n",
			"Fire at the foot of the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of Grace.<br/>\nThus does the superior man proceed<br/>\nWhen clearing up current affairs.<br/>\nBut he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing, does not shine far, in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten and to throw light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions cannot be decided in this way. They require greater earnestness.\n",
			"The wind blows low on the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of Repair.<br/>\nThus the superior man stirs up the people<br/>\nAnd strengthens their spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the wind blow s slow on the mountain, it is thrown back and spoils the vegetation. This contains a challenge to improvement. It is the same with debasing attitudes and fashions, they corrupt human society. His methods likewise must be derived from the two trigrams, but in such a way that their effects unfold in orderly sequence. The superior must first remove stagnation by stirring up public opinion, as the wind stirs up everything, and must strengthen and tranquilize the character of the people, as the mountain gives tranquillity and Nourishment to all that grows in its vicinity.\n",
			"Heaven within the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of Discipline.<br/>\nThus the superior man acquaints himself with many sayings of antiquity<br/>\nAnd many deeds of the past,<br/>\nIn order to strengthen his character thereby.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the words and deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to strengthen and elevate their own characters. The way to study the past is not to confine oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application of this knowledge, to give actuality to the past.\n",
			"The rises over the earth.<br/>\nThe image of Progress.<br/>\nThus the superior man himself<br/>\nBrightens his bright virtue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe light of the rises over the earth is by nature clear. The higher the rises, the more it emerges from the dark mists, spreading the pristine purity of its rays over an ever widening area. The real nature of man is likewise originally good, but it becomes clouded by contact with earthly things and therefore needs purification before it can shine forth in its native clarity.\n",
			"Thunder and lighting.<br/>\nThe image of Resolution.<br/>\nThus the kings of former times made firm the laws<br/>\nThrough clearly defined penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenalties are the individual applications of the law. The laws specify the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severe penalties are differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes. This is symbolized by the clarity of lighting. The law is strengthened by a just application of penalties. This is symbolized by the terror of thunder. This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling respect, it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves. The obstructions in the social life of man increase when there is a lack of clarity in the penal codes and slackness in executing them. The only to strengthen the law is to make it clear and make penalties certain and swift.\n",
			"Fire over water.<br/>\nThe image of the condition before transition.<br/>\nThus the superior man is careful<br/>\nIn the differentiation of things,<br/>\nSo that each finds its place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen fire, which by nature flames upward, is above, and water, which flows downward, is below, their effects take opposite directions and remain unrelated. If we wish to achieve an effect, we must first investigate the nature of the forces in question and ascertain their proper place. If we can bring these forces to bear in the right place, they will have the desired effect and completion will be achieved. But in order to handle external forces properly, we must above all arrive at the correct standpoint ourselves, for only from this vantage can we work correctly.\n",
			"Above, fire, below, the lake.<br/>\nThe image of Opposition.<br/>\nThus amid all fellowship<br/>\nThe superior man retains his individuality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two elements, fire and water, never mingle but even when in contact retain their own natures. So the sutured man is never led into baseness or vulgarity through intercourse or community of interests with persons of another sort, regardless of all commingling, he will always preserve his individuality.\n",
			"Fire on the mountain.<br/>\nThe image of The Wanderer.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nIs clear minded and cautious<br/>\nIn imposing penalties,<br/>\nAnd protracts no lawsuits.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen grass on a mountain takes fire, there is bright light. However, the fire does not linger in one place, but travels on to new fuel. It is a phenomenon of short duration. This is what penalties and lawsuits should be like. They should be a quickly passing matter, and must not be dragged out indefinitely. Prisons ought to be places where people are lodged only temporarily, as guests are. They must not become dwelling places.\n",
			"That which is bright rises twice.<br/>\nThe image of FIRE.<br/>\nThus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,<br/>\nIllumines the four quarters of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of the two trigrams represents the in the course of a day. The two together represent the repeated movement of the the function of light with respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature in the human world. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light to spread farther and farther and to penetrate the nature of man ever more deeply.\n",
			"Fire over wood.<br/>\nThe image of Culture.<br/>\nThus the superior man consolidates his fate<br/>\nBy making his position correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fate of fire depends on wood, as long as there is wood below, the fire burns above. It is the same in human life, there is in man likewise a fate that lends power to his life. And if he succeeds in assigning the right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts his fate on a firm footing. These words contain hints about fostering of life as handed on by oral tradition in the secret teachings of Chinese yoga.\n",
			"Fire in heaven above.<br/>\nthe image of great Possession.<br/>\nThus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good,<br/>\nAnd thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one earth is the image of possession on a grand scale. But a possession of this sort must be administered properly. The brings both evil and good into the light of day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor and promote the good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will of God, who desires only good and not evil.\n",
			"The wind blows over the earth.<br/>\nThe image of Contemplation.<br/>\nThus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,<br/>\nContemplated the people,<br/>\nAnd gave them instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the wind blows over the earth it goes far and wide, and the grass must bend to its power. These two occurrences find confirmation in the hexagram. The two images are used to symbolize a practice of the kings of old, in making regular journeys the ruler could, in the first place, survey his realm and make certain that none of the existing usages of the people escaped notice, in the second, he could exert influence through which such customs as were unsuitable could be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this points to the power possessed by a superior personality. On the one hand, such a man will have a view of the real sentiments of the great mass of humanity and therefore cannot be deceived, on the other, he will impress the people so profoundly, by his mere existence and by the impact of his personality, that they will be swayed by him as the grass by the wind.\n",
			"Wind and thunder, the image of Increase.<br/>\nThus the superior man.<br/>\nIf he sees good, he imitates it,<br/>\nIf he has faults, he rids himself of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile observing how thunder and wind increase and strengthen each other, a man can not the way to self increase and self improvement. When he discovers good in others, he should imitate it and thus make everything on earth his own. If he perceives something bad in himself, let him rid himself of it. In this way he becomes free of evil. This ethical change represents the most important increase of personality.\n",
			"The wind drives over the water.<br/>\nThe image of Dispersion.<br/>\nThus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord<br/>\nAnd built temples.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the autumn and winter, water begins to freeze into ice. When the warm breezes of spring come, the rigidity is dissolved, and the elements that have been dispersed in ice floes are reunited. It is the same with the minds of the people. Through hardness and selfishness the heart grows rigid, and this rigidity leads to separation from all others. Egotism and cupidity isolate men. Therefore the hearts of men must be seized by a devout emotion. They must be shaken by a religious awe in face of eternity stirred with an intuition of the One Creator of all living beings, and united through the strong feeling of fellowship experienced in the ritual of divine worship.\n",
			"Wind over lake, the image of Sincerity.<br/>\nThus the superior man discusses criminal cases<br/>\nIn order to delay executions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWind stirs water by penetrating it. Thus the superior man, when obliged to judge the mistakes of men, tries to penetrate their minds with understanding, in order to gain a sympathetic appreciation of the circumstances. In ancient China, the entire administration of justice was guided by this principle. A deep understanding that knows how to pardon was considered the highest form of justice. This system was not without success, for its aim was to make so strong a moral impression that there was no reason to fear abuse of such mildness. For it sprang not from weakness but from a superior clarity.\n",
			"On the mountain, a tree.<br/>\nThe image of Development.<br/>\nThus the superior man abides in dignity and virtue,<br/>\nIn order to improve the mores.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tree on the mountain is visible from afar, and its development influences the landscape of the entire region. It does not shoot up like a swamp plant, its growth proceeds gradually. Thus also the work of influencing people can be only gradual. No sudden influence or awakening is of lasting effect. Progress must be quite gradual, and in order to obtain such progress in public opinion and in the mores of the people, it is necessary for the personality to acquire influence and weight. This comes about through careful and constant work on one's own moral development.\n",
			"Wind comes forth from fire.<br/>\nThe image of Order.<br/>\nThus the superior man has substance in his words<br/>\nAnd duration in his way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeat creates energy, this is signified by the wind stirred up by the fire and issuing forth form it. This represents influence working from within outward. The same thing is needed in the regulation of the family. Here too the influence on others must proceed form one's own person. In order to be capable of producing such an influence, one's words must have power, and this they can have only if they are based on something real, just as flame depends on its fuel. Words have influence only when they are pertinent and clearly related to definite circumstances. General discourses and admonitions have no effect whatsoever. Furthermore, the words must be supported by one's entire conduct, just as the wind is made effective by it's duration. Only firm and consistent conduct will make such an impression on others that they can adapt and conform to it. If words and conduct are not in order and consistent, they will have no effect.\n",
			"Winds following one upon the other.<br/>\nThe image of The Faith.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nSpreads his commands abroad<br/>\nAnd carries out his undertakings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe penetrating quality of the wind depends upon its ceaselessness. This is what makes it so powerful, time is its instrument. In the same way the ruler's thought should penetrate the soul of the people. This too requires a lasting influence brought about by enlightenment and command. Only when the command has been assimilated by the people is action in accordance with it possible. Action without preparation of the ground only frightens and repels.\n",
			"The wind drives across heaven.<br/>\nThe image of Restraint.<br/>\nThus the superior man<br/>\nRefines the outward aspect of his nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky, yet, being nothing but air, without solid body, it does not produce great or lasting effects. So also an individual, in times when he can produce no great effect in the outer world, can do nothing except refine the expression of his nature in small ways.\n",
			"Heaven and earth do not unite.<br/>\nThe image of Stagnation.<br/>\nThus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth<br/>\nIn order to escape the difficulties.<br/>\nHe does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust prevails in public life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible, because the fundaments are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do under such circumstances, he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling offers to take part in public activities. This would only expose him to danger, since he cannot assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore hides his worth and withdraws into seclusion.\n",
			"Under heaven thunder rolls.<br/>\nAll things attain the natural state of innocence.<br/>\nThus the kings of old,<br/>\nRich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,<br/>\nFostered and nourished all beings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn springtime when thunder, life energy, begins to move again under the heavens, everything sprouts and grows, and all beings receive for the Creative activity of nature the childlike innocence of their original state. So it is with the good rulers of mankind. drawing on the spiritual wealth at their command, they take care of all forms of life and all forms of culture and do everything to further them, and at the proper time.\n",
			"Heaven and water go their opposite ways.<br/>\nThe image of Conflict.<br/>\nThus in all his transactions the superior man<br/>\nCarefully considers the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in the opposing tendencies of the two trigrams. Once these opposing tendencies appear, conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be taken carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties are exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.\n",
			"Heaven above, the lake below.<br/>\nThe image of Conduct.<br/>\nThus the superior man discriminates between high and low,<br/>\nAnd thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in the natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there are necessarily differences of elevation, it is impossible to bring about universal equality. But it is important that differences in social rank should not be arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class struggle are the inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, external differences in rank correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner worth forms the criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order reigns in society.\n",
			"Mountain under heaven, the image of Retreat.<br/>\nThus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,<br/>\nNot angrily but with reserve.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally comes to a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into the distance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of the superior man toward a climbing inferior, he retreats into his own thoughts as the inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for hatred is a form of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object. The superior man shows strength heaven in that he brings the inferior man to a stagnation mountain by his dignified reserve.\n",
			"Heaven together with fire.<br/>\nThe image of Companionship.<br/>\nThus the superior man organizes the clans<br/>\nAnd makes distinctions between things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is different from fire. Just as the luminaries in the sky serve for the systematic division and arrangement of time, so human society and all things that really belong together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should not be a mere mingling of individuals or of things, that would be chaos, not fellowship. If fellowship is to lead to order, there must be organization within diversity.\n",
			"Under heaven, wind.<br/>\nThe image of Encountering.<br/>\nThus does the prince act when disseminating his commands<br/>\nAnd proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation here resembles that in the hexagram Contemplation. In the latter the wind blows over the earth, here it blows under heaven, in both cases it goes everywhere. There the wind is on the earth and symbolizes the ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom, here the wind blows from above and symbolizes the influence exercised by the ruler through his commands. Heaven is far from the things of earth, but it sets them in motion by means of the wind. The ruler is far form his people, but he sets them in motion by means of his commands and decrees.\n",
			"The movement of heaven is full of power.<br/>\nThus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram  indicates the movement of heaven. One complete rotation of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way, by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his activity.\n",

    strJudgement: List[str] = [
			"The Receptive brings about sublime success,<br/>\nFurthering through the perseverance of a mare.<br/>\nIf the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,<br/>\nHe goes astray,<br/>\nBut if he follows, he finds guidance.<br/>\nIt is favorable to find friends in the west and south,<br/>\nTo forego friends in the east and north.<br/>\nQuiet perseverance brings good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe four fundamental aspects of the Creative, sublime success, furthering through perseverance, are also attributed to the Receptive. Here, however, the perseverance is more closely defined. it is that of a mare. The Receptive connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, of a mare, is here added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with faithness and devotion of the cow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness lies in its power to nourish all living things, its greatness lies in its power to give them beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. It is the Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must achieve something. It is not his task to try to lead, that would only make him lose the way but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man lets himself be guided, he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from fate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and the north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional hates and favoritism.\n",
			"Return. Success.<br/>\nGoing out and coming in without error.<br/>\nFriends come without blame.<br/>\nTo and fro goes the way.<br/>\nOn the seventh day comes return.<br/>\nIt furthers one to have somewhere to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The upper trigram is characterized by devotion, thus the movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the transformation of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time, therefore no harm results. Societies of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these groups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of Return is based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning of heaven and earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice, so too sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is the number of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the great darkness, is increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives place to movement.\n",
			"The Army needs perseverance,<br/>\nAnd a strong man.<br/>\nGood fortune without blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting force. Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this discipline must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures the hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he may develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used as a last recourse.\n",
			"Approach has supreme success.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\nWhen the eighth month comes,<br/>\nThere will be misfortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hexagram as a whole points to a time of joyous, hopeful progress. Spring is approaching. Joy and forbearance bring high and low nearer together. Success is certain. But we must work with determination and perseverance to make full use of the propitiousness of the time. And on thing more. spring does not last forever. In the eighth month the aspects are reversed. Then only two strong, light lines are left, these do not advance but are in retreat see next hexagram. We must take heed of this change in good time. If we meet evil before it becomes reality before it has even begun to stir we can master it.\n",
			"Modesty creates success.<br/>\nThe superior man carries things through.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what is modest, when the is at its zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven, turn toward its setand at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, and when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out in the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and to contribute to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters, and the valleys are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full and to prosper the modest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill themselves. But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as his behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive forces. When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he shines with the light of wisdom, if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the end without boasting of what he has achieved.\n",
			"Delusion. In adversity<br/>\nIt furthers one to be persevering.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne must not unresistingly let himself be swept along by unfavorable circumstances, nor permit his steadfastness to be shaken. He can avoid this by maintaining his inner light, while remaining outwardly yielding and tractable. With this attitude he can overcome even the greatest adversities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some situations indeed a man must hide his light, in order to make his will prevail inspite of difficulties in his immediate environment. Perseverance must dwell in inmost consciousness and should not be discernible from without. Only thus is a man able to maintain his will in the face of difficulties.\n",
			"Ascent has supreme success.<br/>\nOne must see the great man.<br/>\nFear not.<br/>\nDeparture toward the south<br/>\nBrings good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ascent of the good elements encounters no obstruction and is therefore accompanied by great success. The ascent is made possible not by violence but by modesty and adaptability. Since the individual is borne along by the propitiousness of the time, he advances. He must go to see authoritative people. He need not be afraid to do this, because success is assured. But he must set to work, for activity this is the meaning of the south brings good fortune.\n",
			"Peace. The small departs,<br/>\nThe great approaches.<br/>\nGood fortune. Success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to be on earth. Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so their powers unite in deep harmony. Then peace and blessing descend upon all living things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the world of man it is a time of social harmony, those in high places show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds.<br/>\n<br/>\nInside, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle, the dark principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while the dark is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good elements of society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil elements come under their influence and change for the better. When the spirit of heaven rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence and takes its appropriate place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe individual lines enter the hexagram from below and leave it again at the top. Here the small, weak, and evil elements are about to take their departure, while the great, strong, and good elements are moving up. This brings good fortune and success.\n",
			"Enthusiasm. It furthers one to install helpers<br/>\nAnd to set armies marching.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time of Enthusiasm derives from the fact that there is at hand an eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts in accord with it. Hence he finds universal and willing obedience. To arouse enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances to the character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability of natural laws rests on this principle of movement along the line of least resistance. Theses laws are not forces external to things but represent the harmony of movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not deviate from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed regularity. It is the same with human society. only such laws are rooted in popular sentiment can be enforced, while laws violating this sentiment merely arouse resentment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, it is enthusiasm that enables us to install helpers for the completion of an undertaking without fear of secret opposition. It is enthusiasm too that can unify mass movements, as in war, so that they achieve victory.\n",
			"Arouse brings success.<br/>\nShock comes oh, oh!<br/>\nLaughing words ha, ha!<br/>\nThe shock terrifies for a hundred miles,<br/>\nAnd he does not let fall the sacrificial spoon and chalice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shock that comes from the manifestation of God within the depths of the earth makes man afraid, but this fear of God is good, for joy and merriment can follow upon it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a man has learned within his heart what fear and trembling mean, he is safeguarded against any terror produced by outside influences. Let the thunder roll and spread terror a hundred miles around. he remains so composed and reverent in spirit that the sacrificial rite is not interrupted. This is the spirit that must animate leaders and rulers of men a profound inner seriousness from which all terrors glance off harmlessly.\n",
			"Deliverance. The southwest furthers.<br/>\nIf there is no longer anything where one has to go,<br/>\nReturn brings good fortune.<br/>\nIf there is still something where one has to go,<br/>\nHastening brings good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis refers to a time in which tensions and complications begin to be eased. At such times we ought to make our way back to ordinary conditions as soon as possible, this is the meaning of the southwest. These periods of sudden change have great importance. Just as rain relieves atmospheric tension, making all the buds burst open, so a time of deliverance from burdensome pressure has a liberating and stimulating effect on life. One thing is important, however. in such times we must not overdo our triumph. The point is not to push on farther than is necessary. Returning to the regular order of life as soon as deliverance is achieved brings good fortune. If there are any residual matters that ought to be attended to, it should be done as quickly as possible, so that a clean sweep is made and no retardations occur.\n",
			"Propriety.<br/>\nUndertakings bring misfortune.<br/>\nNothing that would further.<br/>\n<br/>\nA girl who is taken into the Family, but not as the chief wife, must behave with special caution and reserve. She must not take it upon herself to supplant the mistress of the house, for that would mean chaos and lead to untenable relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same is true of all voluntary relationships between human beings. While legally regulated relationships based on personal inclination depend in the long run entirely on tactful reserve.<br/>\n<br/>\nAffection as the essential principle of relatedness is of the greatest importance in all relationships in the world. For the union of heaven and earth is the origin of the whole of nature. Among human beings likewise, spontaneous affection is the all inclusive principle of union.\n",
			"Surplus. Success.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\nSmall things may be done, great things should not be done.<br/>\nThe flying bird brings the message.<br/>\nIt is not well to strive upward,<br/>\nIt is well to remain below.<br/>\nGreat good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nExceptional modesty and conscientiousness are sure to be rewarded with success, however, if a man is not to throw himself away, it is important that they should not become empty form and subservience but be combined always with a correct dignity in personal behavior. We must understand the demands of the time in order to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies and damages. In any event we must not count on great success, since the requisite strength is lacking. In this lies the importance of the message that one should not strive after lofty things but hold to lowly things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe structure of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message is brought by a bird. In Excess, the four strong, heavy lines within, supported only by two weak lines without, give the image of a sagging ridgepole. Here the supporting weak lines are both outside and preponderant, this gives the image of a soaring bird. But a bird should not try to surpass itself and fly into the it should descend to the earth, where its nest is. In this way it gives the message conveyed by the hexagram.\n",
			"Abundance has success.<br/>\nThe king attains abundance.<br/>\nBe not sad.<br/>\nBe like the at midday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of outstanding greatness and abundance. Only a born ruler of men is able to do it, because his will is directed to what is great. Such a time of abundance is usually brief. Therefore a sage might well feel sad in view of the decline that must follow. But such sadness foes not befit him. Only a man who is inwardly free of sorrow and care can lead in a time of abundance. He must be like the at midday, illuminating and gladdening everything under heaven.\n",
			"Duration. Success. No blame.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\nIt furthers one to have somewhere to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuration is a state whose movement is not worn down by hindrances. It is not a state of rest, for mere stagnation is regression. Duration is rather the self contained and therefore self renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending. The end is reached by an inward movement, by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this movement turns into a new beginning, in which the movement is directed outward, in exhalation, diastole, expansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in their fixed orbits, and because of this their light giving power endures. The seasons of the year follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence can produce effects that endure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo likewise the dedicated man embodies an enduring meaning in his way of life, and thereby the world is formed. In that which gives things their duration, we can come to understand the nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.\n",
			"Power. Perseverance furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hexagram points to a time when inner worth mounts with great force and comes to power. But its strength has already passed beyond the median line, hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one's own power and forget to ask what is right. There is danger too that, being intent on movement, we may not wait for the right time. Therefore the added statement that perseverance furthers. For that is truly great power which does not degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental principles of right and of justice. When we understand this point, namely, that greatness and justice must be indissolubly united, we understand the true meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.\n",
			"Union brings good fortune.<br/>\nInquire of the oracle once again<br/>\nWhether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance,<br/>\nThen there is no blame.<br/>\nThose who are uncertain gradually join.<br/>\nWhoever come too late<br/>\nMeets with misfortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may complement and aid one another through union. But such union calls for a central figure around whom other persons may unite. To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave matter and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit, consistency, and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others about him ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone attempting the task without a real calling for it only makes chaos worse than if no union at all had taken place.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or uncertain gradually come in of their own accord. Late comers must suffer the consequences, for in union the question of the right time is also important. Relationships are formed and firmly established according to definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he who comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it if, as a straggler, he finds the door locked.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong enough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some other organic fellowship.\n",
			"Difficulty works supreme success,<br/>\nFurthering through perseverance.<br/>\nNothing should be undertaken.<br/>\nIt furthers one to appoint helpers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTimes of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to attain form. Everything is in motion, therefore if one perseveres there is a prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man's fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark. Hence he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster. Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone, in order to overcome the chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself should look on passively at what is happening. He must lend his hand and participate with inspiration and guidance.\n",
			"Danger repeated.<br/>\nIf you are sincere, you have success in your heart,<br/>\nAnd whatever you do succeeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and on, and merely fills up all the places through which it flows, it does not shrink from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions. Thus likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can penetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained inner mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will succeed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be done  thoroughness, and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in the danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nProperly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective measure. Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water, separating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger to protect themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil within.\n",
			"Limitation. Success.<br/>\nGalling limitation must not be persevered in.<br/>\n<br/>\nLimitations are troublesome, but they are effective. If we live economically in normal times, we are prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves us from humiliation. Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation of world conditions. In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter, day and night, and these limits give the year its meaning. In the same way, economy, by setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve property and prevent injury to the people.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in limitation we must observe due measure. If a man should seek to impose galling limitations upon his own nature, it would be injurious. And if he should go too far in imposing limitations on others, they would rebel. Therefore it is necessary to set limits even upon limitation.\n",
			"Obstruction. The southwest furthers.<br/>\nThe northeast does not further.<br/>\nIt furthers one to see the great man.<br/>\nPerseverance brings good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe southwest is the region of retreat, the northeast that of advance. Here an individual is confronted by obstacles that cannot be overcome directly. In such a situation it is wise to pause in view of the danger and to retreat. However, this is merely a preparation for overcoming the obstructions. One must join forces with friends of like mind and put himself under the leadership of a man equal to the situation, then one will succeed in removing the obstacles. This requires the will to persevere just when one apparently must do something that leads away from his goal. This unswerving inner purpose brings good fortune in the end. An obstruction that lasts only for a time is useful for self development. This is the value of adversity.\n",
			"After Completion. Success in small matters.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\nAt the beginning good fortune.<br/>\nAt the end chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe transition from the old to the new time is already accomplished. In principle, everything stands systematized, and it si only in regard to details that success is still to be achieved. In respect to this, however, we must be careful to maintain the right attitude. Everything proceeds as if of its own accord, and this can all too easily tempt us to relax and let thing take their course without troubling over details. Such indifference is the root of all evil. Symptoms of decay are bound to be the result. Here we have the rule indicating the usual course of history. But this rule is not an inescapable law. He who understands it is in position to avoid its effects by dint of unremitting perseverance and caution.\n",
			"The Well. The town may be changed,<br/>\nBut the Well cannot be changed.<br/>\nIt neither decreases nor increases.<br/>\nThey come and go and draw from the Well.<br/>\nIf one gets down almost to the water<br/>\nAnd the rope does not go all the way,<br/>\nOr the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for the sake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties. The style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of the Well has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the Well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Political structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remains eternally the same this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible. It grows neither less not more, it exists for one and for all. The generations come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social organization of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life. For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs unsatisfied is as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made. Carelessness by which the jug is broken is also disastrous. If for instance the military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same in everyone. And every human being can draw in the course of his education from the inexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man's nature. But here likewise two dangers threaten. a man may fail in his education to penetrate to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention a partial education of this sort is as bad as none or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self development.\n",
			"Delay. If you are sincere,<br/>\nYou have light and success.<br/>\nPerseverance brings good fortune.<br/>\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>\n<br/>\nDelay is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success. This leads to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows itself in uncompromising truthfulness with himself. It is only when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross the great water, that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary decision and of surmounting the danger.\n",
			"Accumulation. Success.<br/>\nThe king approaches his temple.<br/>\nIt furthers one to see the great man.<br/>\nThis brings success. Perseverance furthers.<br/>\nTo bring great offerings creates good fortune.<br/>\nIt furthers one to undertake something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe accumulation of people in large communities is either a natural occurrence, as in the case of the Family, or an artificial one, as in the case of the state. The Family gathers about the father as its head. The perpetuation of this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice to the ancestors, at which the whole clan is gathered together. Through the collective piety of the living members of the Family, the ancestors become so integrated in the spiritual life of the Family that it cannot be dispersed or dissolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere men are to be gathered together, religious forces are needed. But there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the group. In order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first of all be collected within himself. Only collective moral force can unite the world. Such great times of unification will leave great achievements behind them. This is the significance of the great offerings that are made. In the secular sphere likewise there is no need of great deeds in the time of Accumulation.\n",
			"Pursuit has supreme success.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers. No blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to obtain a pursuit one must first know how to adapt oneself. If a man would rule he must first learn to serve, for only in this way does he secure from those below him pleasure assent that is necessary if they are to follow him. If he has to obtain a pursuit by force or cunning, by conspiracy or by creating faction, he invariably arouses resistance, which obstructs willing adherence. But even joyous movement can lead to evil consequences, hence the added stipulation, Perseverance furthers, that is, consistency in doing right, together with No blame. Just as we should not ask others to follow us unless this condition is fulfilled, so it is only under this condition that we can in turn follow others without coming to harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thought of obtaining a pursuit through adaptation to the demands of the time is a great and significant idea, this is why the appended judgment is so favorable.\n",
			"Oppression. Success. Perseverance.<br/>\nThe great man brings about good fortune.<br/>\nNo blame.<br/>\nWhen one has something to say,<br/>\nIt is not believed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTimes of adversity are the reverse of times of success, but they can lead to success if they, befall the right man. When a strong man meets with adversity, he remains cheerful despite all danger, and this cheerfulness is the source of later successes, it is that stability which is stronger than fate. He who lets his spirit be broken by exhaustion certainly has no success. But if adversity only bends a man, it creates in him a power to react that is bound in time to manifest itself. No inferior man is capable of this. Only the great man brings about goof fortune and remains blameless. It is true that for the time being outward influence is denied him, because his words have no effect. Therefore in times of adversity it is important to be strong within and sparing of words.\n",
			"Pleasure. Success.<br/>\nPerseverance is favorable.<br/>\n<br/>\nPleasure mood is infectious and therefore brings success. But joy must be based on steadfastness if it is not to degenerate into uncontrolled mirth. Truth and strength must dwell in the heart, while gentleness reveals itself in social intercourse. In this way one assumes the right attitude toward God and man and achieves something. Under certain conditions, intimidation without gentleness may achieve something momentarily, but not for all time. When, on the other hand, the hearts of men are won by friendliness, they are led to take all hardships upon themselves willingly, and if need be will not shun death itself, so great is the power of joy over men.\n",
			"Influence. Success.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\nTo take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weak element is above, the strong below, hence their powers attract each other, so that they unite. This brings about success, for all success depends on the effect of mutual attraction. By meditation within while experiencing joy without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess and hold it within proper bounds. This is the meaning of the added admonition, Perseverance furthers, for it is perseverance that makes the difference between seduction and courtship, in the latter the strong man takes a position inferior to that of the weak girl and shows consideration for her. This attraction between affinities is a general law of nature. Heaven and earth attract each other and thus all creatures come into being. Through such attraction the sage influences men's hearts, and thus the world attains peace. From the attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.\n",
			"Revolution. On your own day<br/>\nYou are believed.<br/>\nSupreme success,<br/>\nFurthering through perseverance.<br/>\nRemorse disappears.<br/>\n<br/>\nPolitical revolutions are extremely grave matters. They should be undertaken only under stress of direst necessity, when there is no other way out. Not everyone is called to this task, but only the man who has the confidence of the people, and even he only when the time is ripe. He must then proceed in the right way, so that he gladdens the people and, by enlightening them, prevents excesses. Furthermore, he must be quite free of selfish aims and must really relieve the need of the people. Only then does he have nothing to regret.<br/>\n<br/>\nTimes change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasons change in the course of the year. In the world cycle also there are spring and autumn in the life of peoples and nations, and these call for social transformations.\n",
			"Excess.<br/>\nThe ridgepole sags to the breaking point.<br/>\nIt furthers one to have somewhere to go.<br/>\nSuccess.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weight of the great is excessive. The load is too heavy for the strength of the supports. The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests, sags to the breaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for the load they bear. It is an exceptional time and situation, therefore extraordinary measures are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of transition as quickly as possible, and to take action. This promises success. For although the strong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center of gravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared. Nothing is to be achieved by forcible measures. The problem must be solved by gently penetration to the meaning of the situation as is suggested by the attribute of the inner trigram, then the change over to other conditions will be successful. It demands real superiority, therefore the time when the great preponderates is a momentous time.\n",
			"Breakthrough. One must resolutely make the matter known<br/>\nAt the court of the king.<br/>\nIt must be announced truthfully. Danger.<br/>\nIt is necessary to notify one's own city.<br/>\nIt does not further to resort to arms.<br/>\nIt furthers one to undertake something.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if only one inferior man is occupying a ruling position in a city, he is able to oppress superior men. Even a single passion still lurking in the heart has power to obscure reason. Passion and reason cannot exist side by side therefore fight without quarter is necessary if the good is to prevail.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a resolute struggle of the good against evil, there are, however, definite rules that must not be disregarded, if it is to succeed. First, resolution must be based on a union of strength and friendliness. Second, a compromise with evil is not possible, evil must under all circumstances be openly discredited. Nor must our own passions and shortcomings be glossed over. Third, the struggle must not be carried on directly by force. If evil is branded, it thinks of weapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting against it blow for blow, we lose in the end because thus we ourselves get entangled in hatred and passion. Therefore it is important to begin at home, to be on guard in our own persons against the faults we have branded. In this way, finding no opponent, the sharp edges of the weapons of evil becomes dulled. For the same reasons we should not combat our own faults directly. As long as we wrestle with them, they continue victorious. Finally, the best way to fight evil is to make energetic progress in the good.\n",
			"Disintegration. it does not further one<br/>\nTo go anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis pictures a time when inferior people are pushing forward and are about to crowd out the few remaining strong and superior men. Under these circumstances, which are due to the time, it is not favorable for the superior man to undertake anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe right behavior in such adverse times is to be deduced from the images and their attributes. The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose attributes. The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose attributes are docility and devotion. The upper trigram stands for the mountain, whose attribute is stillness. This suggests that one should submit to the bad time and remain quiet. For it is a question not of man's doing but of time conditions, which, according to the laws of heaven, show an alternation of increase and decrease, fullness and emptiness. It is impossible to counteract these conditions of the time. Hence it is not cowardice but wisdom to submit and avoid action.\n",
			"Nourishment.<br/>\nPerseverance brings good fortune.<br/>\nPay heed to the providing of Nourishment<br/>\nAnd to what a man seeks<br/>\nTo fill his own mouth with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn bestowing care and Nourishment, it is important that the right people should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own Nourishment in the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters and takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through them. Mencius says about this.\n",
			"Inexperience has success.<br/>\nIt is not I who seek the young fool,<br/>\nThe young fool seeks me.<br/>\nAt the first oracle I inform him.<br/>\nIf he asks two or three times, it is importunity.<br/>\nIf he importunes, I give him no information.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.<br/>\n<br/>\nA teacher's answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite like that expected from an oracle, thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.\n",
			"Decrease combined with sincerity<br/>\nBrings about supreme good fortune<br/>\nWithout blame.<br/>\nOne may be persevering in this.<br/>\nIt furthers one to undertake something.<br/>\nHow is this to be carried out?<br/>\nOne may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDecrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad. Increase and decrease come in their own time. What matters here is to understand the time and not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense. If a time of scanty resources brings out an sincerity, one must not feel ashamed of simplicity. For simplicity is then the very thing needed to provide inner strength for further undertakings. Indeed, there need by no concern if the outward beauty of the civilization, even the elaboration of religious forms, should have to suffer because of simplicity. One must draw on the strength of the inner attitude to compensate for what is lacking in externals, then the power of the content makes up for the simplicity of form. There is no need of presenting false appearances to God. Even with slender means, the sentiment of the heart can be expressed.\n",
			"Meditation. Keeping his back still<br/>\nSo that he no longer feels his body.<br/>\nHe goes into his courtyard<br/>\nAnd does not see his people.<br/>\nNo blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue quiet means meditation when the time has come to keep still, and going forward when the time has come to go forward. In this way rest and movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there is light in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement. The back is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibers that mediate movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a stagnation, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as it were. When a man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He no longer sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and therefore he has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding the great laws of the universe and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever acts from these deep levels makes no mistakes.\n",
			"Grace has success.<br/>\nIn small matters<br/>\nIt is favorable to undertake something.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace brings success. However, it is not the essential or fundamental thing, it is only the ornament and therefore be used sparingly and only in little things. In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between two strong lines and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the essential content and the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper trigram of the mountain, the strong line takes the lead, so that here again the strong element must be regarded as the decisive factor. In nature we see in the sky the strong light of the the life of the world depends on it. But this strong, essential thing is changed and given pleasing variety by the moon and the stars. In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when traditions exist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are made pleasing by a lucid beauty. By contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we come to understand time and its changing demands. Through contemplation of the forms existing in human society it becomes possible to shape the world.\n",
			"Repair, has supreme success.<br/>\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>\nBefore the starting point, three days.<br/>\nAfter the starting point, three days.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has been spoiled through man's fault can be made good again through man's work. It is not immutable fate, as in the time of Stagnation, that has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom. Work toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the possibilities of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger symbolized by crossing of the great water but must take hold energetically. Success depends, however, on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines, Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days. We must first know the cause of corruption before we can do away with them, hence it is necessary to be cautious during the time before the start. Then we must see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that a relapse may be avoided, therefore we must pay attention to the time after the start. Decisiveness and energy must take the place of inertia and indifference that have led to decay, in order that the ending may be followed by a new beginning.\n",
			"Discipline.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\nNot eating at home brings good fortune.<br/>\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear headed man who is honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power, indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self renewal can a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times, but in periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's bread by entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven, therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.\n",
			"Progress. The powerful prince<br/>\nIs honored with horses in large numbers.<br/>\nIn a single day he is granted audience three times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example of progress, this pictures a time when a powerful feudal lord rallies the other lords around the sovereign and pledges fealty and peace. The sovereign rewards him richly and invites him to a closer intimacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nA twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the progress emanates from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others regard as their equal and are therefore willing to follow. This leader has enough clarity of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use it rather for the benefit of his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all jealousy, showers presents on the great man, and invites him continually to his court. An enlightened ruler and an obedient servant, this is the condition on which great progress depends.\n",
			"Resolution has success.<br/>\nIt is favorable to let justice be administered.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen an obstacle to union arises, energetic resolution brings success. This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord. Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines clarity, and excitement. is yielding, is hard. Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out punishment, unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes the decisions represented by the fifth line is gentle by nature, while he commands respect by his conduct in his position.\n",
			"Before Completion. Success.<br/>\nBut if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing,<br/>\nGets his tail in the water,<br/>\nThere is nothing that would further.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conditions are difficult. The task is great and full of responsibility. It is nothing less than that of leading the world out of chaos back to order. But it is a task that promises success, because there is a goal that can unite the forces now tending in different directions. At first, however, one must move warily, like an old fox walking over ice. The caution of a fox walking over ice is proverbial in China. His ears are constantly alert to the cracking of the ice, as he carefully and circumspectly searches out the safest spots. A young fox who as yet has not acquired this caution goes ahead boldly, and it may happen that he falls in and gets his tail wet when he is almost across the water. Then of course his effort has been all in vain. Accordingly, in times before Completion, deliberation and caution are the prerequisites of success.\n",
			"Opposition. In small matters, good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people live in opposition and estrangement they cannot carry out a great undertaking in common, their points of view diverge too widely. In such circumstances one should above all not proceed brusquely, for that would only increase the existing opposition, instead, one should limit oneself to producing gradual effects in small matters. Here success can still be expected, because the situation is such that the opposition does not preclude all agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when it represents polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful and important functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and nature, man and woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and reproduction of life. In the world of visible things, the principle of opposites makes possible the differentiation by categories through which order is brought into the world.\n",
			"The Wanderer. Success through smallness.<br/>\nPerseverance brings good fortune<br/>\nTo the Wanderer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a man is a wanderer and stranger, he should not be gruff nor overbearing. He has no large circle of acquaintances, therefore he should not give himself airs. He must be cautious and reserved, in this way he protects himself from evil. If he is obliging toward others, he wins success.<br/>\n<br/>\nA wanderer has no fixed abode, his home is the road. Therefore he must take care to remain upright and steadfast, so that he sojourns only in the proper places, associating only with good people. Then he has good fortune and can go his way unmolested.\n",
			"Clarity. Perseverance furthers.<br/>\nIt brings success.<br/>\nCare of the cow brings good fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of the latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself something that perseveres, otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything that gives light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may continue to shine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus the and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling to the earth. So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to what is right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.\n",
			"Culture. Supreme good fortune.<br/>\nSuccess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile The Well relates to the social foundation of our life, and this foundation is likened to the water that serves to nourish growing wood, the present hexagram refers to the cultural superstructure of society. Here it is the wood that serves as Nourishment for the flame, the spirit. All that is visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the invisible. Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes firm root in the cosmic order.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we see civilization as it reaches its culmination in religion. The ting serves in offering sacrifice to God. The highest earthly values must be sacrificed to the divine. But the truly divine does not manifest itself apart from man. The supreme revelation of God appears in prophets and holy men. To venerate them is true veneration of God. The will of God, as revealed through them, should be accepted in humility, this brings inner enlightenment and true understanding of the world, and this leads to great good fortune and success.\n",
			"Possession.<br/>\nSupreme success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions great measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is it possible that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast and to possess them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is favorable, a time of strength within, clarity and culture without. Power is expressing itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme success and wealth.\n",
			"Contemplation. The ablution has been made,<br/>\nBut not yet the offering.<br/>\nFull of trust they look up to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sacrificial ritual in China began with an ablution and a libation by which the Deity was invoked, after which the sacrifice was offered. The moment of time between these two ceremonies is the most sacred of all, the moment of deepest inner concentration. If piety is sincere and expressive of real faith, the contemplation of it has a transforming awe spiring effect on those who witness it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the fact that natural occurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of the divine meaning underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who is called upon to influence others the means of producing like effects. This requires that power of inner concentration which religious contemplation develops in great men strong in faith. It enables them to apprehend the mysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of profoundest inner concentration they give expression to these laws in their own persons. Thus a hidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing and dominating others without their being aware of how it happens.\n",
			"Increase. It furthers one<br/>\nTo undertake something.<br/>\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>\n<br/>\nSacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below fills the people with a sense of joy and gratitude that is extremely valuable for the flowering of the commonwealth. When people are thus devoted to their leaders, undertakings are possible, and even difficult and dangerous enterprises will succeed. Therefore in such times of progress and successful development it is necessary to work and make the best use of time. This time resembles that of the marriage of heaven and earth, when the earth partakes of the Creative power of heaven, forming and bringing forth living beings. The time of Increase does not endure, therefore it must be utilized while it lasts.\n",
			"Dispersion. Success.<br/>\nThe king approaches his temple.<br/>\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe text of this hexagram resembles that of Ts'ui, Accumulation. In the latter, the subject is the bringing together of elements that have been separated, as water collects in lakes upon the earth. Here the subject is the dispersing and dissolving of divisive egotism. Dispersion shows the way, so to speak, that leads to accumulation. This explains the similarity of the two texts.<br/>\n<br/>\nReligious forces are needed to overcome the egotism that divides men. The common celebration of the great sacrificial feasts and sacred rites, which gave expression simultaneously to the interrelation and social articulation of the Family and state, was the means of employed by the great ruler to unite men. The sacred music and the splendor of the ceremonies aroused a strong tide of emotion that was shared by all hearts in unison, and that awakened a consciousness of the common origin of all creatures. In this way disunity was overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further means to the same end is co operation in great general undertakings that set a high goal for the will of the people, in the common concentration on this goal, all barriers dissolve, just as, when a boat is crossing a great stream, all hands must unite in a joint task.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut only a man who is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations, and who perseveres in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so dissolving the hardness of egotism.\n",
			"Sincerity. Pigs and fishes.<br/>\nGood fortune.<br/>\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPigs and fishes are the least intelligent of all animals and therefore the most difficult to influence. The force of sincerity must grow great indeed before its influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing with persons as intractable and as difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole secret of success depends on finding the right way of approach. One must first rid oneself of all prejudice and, so to speak, let the psyche of the other person act on one without restraint. Then one will establish contact with him, understand and gain power over him. When a door has thus been opened, the force of one's personality will influence him. If in this way one finds no obstacles insurmountable, one can undertake even the most dangerous things, such as crossing the great water, and succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it is important to understand upon what the force sincerity depends. This force is not identical with simple intimacy or a secret bond. Close ties may exist also among thieves, it is true that such a bond acts as a force but, since it is not invincible, it does not bring good fortune. All association on the basis of common interests holds only up to a certain point. Where the community of interest ceases, the union ceases also, and the closest friendship often changes into hate. Only when the bond is based on what is right, on steadfastness, will it remain so firm that it triumphs over everything.\n",
			"Development. The maiden<br/>\nIs given in marriage.<br/>\nGood fortune.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe development of events that leads to a girl's pursuit a man to his home proceeds slowly. The various formalities must be disposed of before the marriage takes place. This principle of gradual development can be applied to other situations as well, it is always applicable where it is a matter of correct relationships of co operation, as for instance in the appointment of an official. The development must be allowed to take its proper course. Hasty action would not be wise. This is also true, finally, of any effort to exert influence on others, for here too the essential factor is a correct way of development through cultivation of one's own personality. No influence such as that exerted by agitators has a lasting effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin the personality too, development must follow the same course if lasting results are to be achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but at the same time penetrais the outer form that should proceed from inner calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very gradualness of the development makes it necessary to have perseverance, for perseverance alone prevents slow progress from dwindling to nothing.\n",
			"The Family. The perseverance of the woman furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe foundation of the Family is the relationship between husband and wife. The tie that hold the Family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. The tie that holds the Family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. Her place is within second line, while that of the husband is without fifth line. It is in accord with the great laws of nature that husband and wife take their proper places. Within the Family a strong authority is needed, this is represented by the parents. If the father is really a father and the son a son, if the elder brother fulfills his position, and the younger fulfills his, if the husband is really a husband and the wife a wife, then the Family is in order. When the Family is in order, all the social relationships of mankind will be in order.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree of the five social relationships are to be found within the Family that between father and son, which is the relation of love, that between the husband and wife, which is the relation of chaste conduct, and that between elder and younger brother, which is the relation of correctness. The loving reverence of the son is then carried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness to duty, the affection and correctness of behavior existing between the two brothers are extended to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in the form of deference. The Family is society in the embryo, it is the native soil on which performance of moral duty is made early through natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of moral practice is created, and this is later widened to include human relationships in general.\n",
			"Faith. Success through what is small.<br/>\nIt furthers one to have somewhere to go.<br/>\nIt furthers one to see the great man.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenetration produces gradual and inconspicuous effects. It should be effected not by an act of violation but by influence that never lapses. Results of this kind are less striking to the eye than those won by surprise attack, but they are more enduring and more complete. If one would produce such effects, one must have a clearly defined goal, for only when the penetrating influence works always in the same direction can the object be attained. Small strength can achieve its purpose only by subordinating itself to an eminent man who is capable of creating order.\n",
			"Restraint<br/>\nHas success.<br/>\nDense clouds, no rain from our western region.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis image refers to the state of affairs in China at the time when King W�n, who came originally from the west, was in the east at the court of the reigning tyrant Chou Hsin. The moment for action on a large scale had not yet arrived. King W�n could only keep the tyrant somewhat in check by friendly persuasion. Hence the image of many clouds, promising moisture and blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not unfavorable, there is a prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles in the way, and we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the small means of friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has not yet come for sweeping measures. However, we may be able, to a limited extent, to act as a restraining and subduing influence. To carry out our purpose we need firm determination within and gentleness and adaptability in external relations.\n",
			"Stagnation. Evil people do not further<br/>\nThe perseverance of the superior man.<br/>\nThe great departs, the small approaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What is above has no relation to what is below, and on earth chaos and chaos prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. Weakness is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without are the superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent, the way of superior people is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow themselves to be turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting influence is closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and withdraw into seclusion.\n",
			"Innocence. Supreme success.<br/>\nPerseverance furthers.<br/>\nIf someone is not as he should be,<br/>\nHe has misfortune,<br/>\nAnd it does not further him<br/>\nTo undertake anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMan has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him in all his movements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage. This instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and furthers through perseverance. However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will of heaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecinstinctive way of acting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this. He who departs from innocence, what does he come to? Heaven's will and blessing do not go with his deeds.\n",
			"Conflict. You are sincere<br/>\nAnd are being obstructed.<br/>\nA cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.<br/>\nGoing through to the end brings misfortune.<br/>\nIt furthers one to see the great man.<br/>\nIt does not further one to cross the great water.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs into opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to craftiness or high handed encroachment but not to open conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity is then perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to conquer danger without.\n",
			"Conduct. Treading upon the tail of the tiger.<br/>\nIt does not bite the man. Success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that which is weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong and worries it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the weak, because the contact is in good humor and harmless.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, intractable people. In such a case one's purpose will be achieved if one behaves with decorum. Pleasant manners succeed even with irritable people.\n",
			"Retreat. Success.<br/>\nIn what is small, perseverance furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nConditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time are advancing. In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to be confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances, whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss the right moment while we are in full possession of power and position. Then we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too late and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of being drawn into a desperate life and death struggle. Thus we do not simple abandon the field to the opponent, we make it difficult for him to advance by showing perseverance in single acts of resistance. In this way we prepare, while retreafor the counter movement. Understanding the laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is not easy. The meaning that lies hidden in such a time is important.\n",
			"Companionship in the open.<br/>\nSuccess.<br/>\nIt furthers one to cross the great water.<br/>\nThe perseverance of the superior man furthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is universal. It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting fellowship among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said that companionship in the open succeeds. If unity of this kind prevails, even difficult and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can be accomplished. But in order to bring about this sort of fellowship, a persevering and enlightened leader is needed, a man with clear, convincing, and inspiring aims and the strength to carry them out. The inner trigram means clarity, the outer, strength.\n",
			"Encountering. The maiden is powerful.<br/>\nOne should not marry such a maiden.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the image of a bold girl who lightly surrenders herself and thus seizes power. This would not be possible if the strong and light giving element had not in turn come halfway. The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a man delights in it, it looks so small and weak that he imagines he may dally with it and come to no harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe inferior man rises only because the superior man does not regard him as dangerous and so lends him power. If he were resisted from the fist, he could never gain influence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time of Encountering is important in still another way. Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, there are times when this has great significance. When heaven and earth come to meet each other, all creatures prosper, when a prince and his official come to meet each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result.\n",
			"The Creative works sublime success,<br/>\nFurthering through perseverance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the original meaning, the attributes sublimity, potentiality of success, power to further, perseverance are paired. When an individual draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by sublime means literally head, origin, great. This is why Confucius says in explaining it. Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative, all beings owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven. For this attribute inheres in the other three as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend form to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and the process is represented by an image from nature. The clouds pass and the rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms.<br/>\n<br/>\nApplies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to notable success. Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them at the right time, as though on six dragons. The six steps are the six different positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and giving actuality to the way of the universe Tao, which, as a law running through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms furthering literally, creating that which accords with the nature of a given being and persevering literally, correct and firm. The course of the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus does it show itself to further through perseverance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in creating order. He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother line of speculation goes still further in separating the words sublime, success, furthering, perseverance, and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already broached in the commentary, later formed the bridge connecting the philosophy of the five stages elements of change, as laid down in the Book of History with the philosophy of the Book of Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.\n",
